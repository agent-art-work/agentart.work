# Agent Art Work handoff

[Agent Art Work v2.0.0](https://github.com/agent-art-work/agentart.work/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
is the stable website release, published on 2026-10-25 at commit
`34eb92745d39e192f16719f7a6926784f697592d` and deployed at
[agentart.work](https://agentart.work/). The approved manifesto remains locked.
The released site includes the manifesto-led home, separate definition, Works
showroom, Protocol, Ask your Agent, About and Blog. Blog remains in the footer;
the top bar contains Agent Art, Protocol, Works, GitHub and X.

This repository owns website maintenance and Blog publishing. The separate
protocol repository retains SDK implementation and release ownership; its
bundled SDK remains `0.1.5-alpha.2`. Earlier candidate and local-only entries
below describe prior stages, not outstanding release work.

## Read first

1. [README](README.md) and [AGENTS](AGENTS.md): purpose, work lanes and authority.
2. [Current position](#current-position): released baseline, current work and remaining limits.
3. Current sections of [organization context](docs/ORGANIZATION_AND_SPLIT.md):
   website, Protocol and artist ownership.

Follow the requested lane: [site maintenance](site/README.md) for website work,
[Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) for Blog publishing, or [Research guidance](GUIDANCE.md) and
the relevant collection for an explicitly chosen research question. Study
intake, THOUGHT diagnostics and findings review are not routine site prerequisites.

Lab remains historical context and an optional research practice. The earlier
dated instructions, trial proposals and “next action” entries below are retained
records, not a standing queue. Resume one only when the current request calls
for it. The cross-site audit brief below is likewise specific to that audit;
it does not make every website edit a new full audit. Preserve records and URLs.
Local preview work remains local until publication is authorized.

## Independent cross-site boundary review — 2026-10-24

Historical audit brief: the candidate paths and publication status below describe
2026-10-24. Agent Art Work has since released v2.0.0; this does not establish
Inshell's deployment status or authorize resuming the audit.

The operator requests a handoff for a standalone agent to independently audit
the **local** Agent Art Work v2 site and the reconciled Inshell docs. Lane:
documentation/editorial review. Report findings and proposed corrections first;
this review does not authorize publishing, changing artwork runtimes or editing
the locked manifesto. No reviewer has been assigned by this handoff.

### Review the right candidates

| Candidate | Checkout and revision | Preview |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Art Work | this repository root (`.`); branch `codex/manifesto-home`; HEAD `225d09591ae6ba012176f1cc002738e9d6fef11f` plus substantial uncommitted v2 changes | `http://127.0.0.1:8877/`; `/agent-art/` responded successfully at handoff |
| Inshell docs | `/private/tmp/inshell-docs-agent-art-work-reconciliation`; branch `codex/docs-agent-art-work-reconciliation`; HEAD `1a44454d4904fdc330f83ec3d86236783302411f` plus uncommitted reconciliation | No preview of this candidate was identified at handoff; start a docs preview from this checkout using its maintained instructions and existing dependencies |

Inspect current working files, including untracked files, rather than HEAD
alone. Recheck paths and server roots when starting. The Inshell servers found
on ports 5177/5176 belong to the separate `inshell-art-lan` checkout, **not** the
docs candidate. Do not treat those pages or the live website as evidence for
this reconciliation. Leave other checkouts and their servers unchanged.

Read each repository's applicable AGENTS instructions. Here, start with README,
GUIDANCE, this handoff and `docs/ORGANIZATION_AND_SPLIT.md`, particularly its
24-topic placement map. On Inshell read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md` and
`apps/home/src/content/AGENTS.md`.

### Operator-approved boundaries to test

- Agent Art Work is this initiative's source of truth for the definition,
  manifesto, shared Protocol and tools. Inshell is the first builder artist,
  not a parallel authority for the field. The separate `agent-art-protocol`
  repository owns the specification, SDK and component releases.
- Canonical definition: **Agent Art is art in which an Agent’s intention enters
  the work as an artistic contribution alongside human intention.** Intentions
  have equal artistic standing and consequence; this does not demand identical
  roles, control, contribution size or acceptance of every Agent proposal.
  Intention need not be wholly original or independent of prompting/learning.
- The defining concern is intentional artistic contribution. A model call,
  generated object, unpredictable result or protocol pass alone does not
  establish it. Do not invent a consciousness or technical architecture test.
- Medium, generative techniques, SVG, onchain preservation and community belong
  to particular practices. A painter can make Agent Art without code or
  Protocol. Inshell owns its anonymous artist identity, inspect self direction,
  THOUGHT/WILL/AWA, materials, mechanics and release choices.
- Artists decide whether and how to present evidence; audiences judge. Protocol
  is optional infrastructure for digital/software interactions, not an artistic
  certifier or a universal evidence requirement. Conversely, artistic discretion
  does not waive the technical verification/security obligations of Inshell's
  chosen systems or the evidence standards for published research claims.
- Works is an attributed showroom, not an artwork runtime or transfer of
  ownership. Blog carries articles/studies. Ask your Agent is a reading handoff;
  using it does not by itself constitute artistic participation.
- Preserve dated historical records and attribution. Distinguish them from
  contradictory current guidance. Keep the approved manifesto locked; report
  any perceived tension for editorial decision rather than silently changing it.

### Audit coverage and evidence

Review Agent Art Work's home, Agent Art, Protocol, Ask your Agent, Works, About,
Guidance and relevant boundary/collection text, alongside **all 24 Inshell docs
topics**. Pay particular attention to agent-art, agents-and-ai, glossary,
lineage, generative-art, movements and verification. Review figures, captions,
navigation, summaries and Agent-readable exports as well as body prose.

Here, canonical sources are `docs/*.md`, GUIDANCE and relevant collection
READMEs; HTML and downloads are built by `scripts/build-site.mjs`. On Inshell,
inspect `apps/home/src/content/docs.ts`, `docs-figure-logic.ts`, the source
registry and the generated `apps/home/public/docs/` Markdown/JSON/indexes.
Generated exports must agree with authored text; do not hand-edit them.

Check actual rendered pages in regular Google Chrome
(`/Applications/Google Chrome.app`, bundle `com.google.Chrome`) and compare
them with source/export wording. Verify the preview serves the candidate under
review. No Chrome Beta. Close only review-owned temporary tabs/processes.
If a preview cannot run, continue source/export review and explicitly leave
rendered verification unverified. Do not turn an unavailable surface into a pass.

Local checks here: `npm run build`, `npm run check:site`, `npm test`,
`python3 -B scripts/check.py`, and
`python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests`. On Inshell use its scoped docs
generator/drift and docs tests after checking scripts and dependency availability;
avoid unrelated full product or deployment suites for this editorial audit.
Earlier passing results are maintainer reports, not independent audit evidence.

### Known limits and required report

Inshell's earlier exact offline install lacked `@playwright/test@1.64.0`.
Checks used an existing toolchain and did not qualify a clean pinned build.
At this handoff, dependency symlinks are present again, including
`apps/home/node_modules` pointing into the maintenance-integration checkout.
Inspect dependency resolution and disclose it; do not silently install, replace
or remove shared dependencies. Its currently observed `source-lock.json`
SHA-256 is `7b648c388398a0a7f070c503297f0a91cebb7b62ed0103086071737dfe8bd849`,
superseding the earlier recorded digest for purposes of candidate identification.
The locked manifesto and its approved draft both hash to
`7cce72483d34d7903a86a76620b9d3c3ac4c3880074e0f8e63679d8747406e61`.

Return a verdict: **boundaries hold**, **hold with specific exceptions**, or
**do not hold**. List findings by importance with exact quotations, source
path/line and local route, the violated boundary, a minimal proposed correction
and the owning repository. Separate active contradictions from historical
context and harmless artist-specific choices. Include a coverage list, checks
actually run, missing evidence and remaining release limitations. A no-findings
result still needs coverage and limitations. Do not commit, push, deploy,
rewrite history, change SDK/runtime code or contact other sessions as part of
this independent review without further operator direction.

Both v2 candidates remain local. Future publication requires verified Agent Art
Work v2 destinations before Inshell's new cross-site links are released, under
the respective maintainers' release authority.

## Current position

### Discourse structure — 29 October 2026

Lane: optional research documentation, implementing the operator-approved discourse plan. The [discourse workspace](public-discourse/manifesto-discourse/README.md) now contains both routes, platform guides, the Agent Art mapping, an exact manifesto snapshot, inherited 28 October screening, templates and an unrun Q06 trial proposal. No live participation or community re-verification occurred. The GitHub directory structure was checked on 29 October. The operator then requested `public-discourse/` with sibling `avatar/` and `manifesto-discourse/` folders; both collections now use those paths. Avatar contents are unchanged. Existing website sources and manifesto wording are unchanged. Next action: review this structure, then check three communities before selecting and authorizing live A/B trials. The operator explicitly requested direct publication to `main` on 29 October 2026, replacing the PR-based delivery. PR #19 is closed without merging; the files are committed directly to the repository. No new license or separate versioned release is introduced. The existing Pages workflow runs automatically on the main-branch push.


- 2026-10-27 repository maintenance, **social media avatar archive**: corrected
  `discourse/agent-art-manifesto/avatart/` to
  [avatar](public-discourse/avatar/README.md) and imported the agreed
  prototypes and concept. The README identifies only the current yellow organic
  `a-crowd-ball` avatar. Its supplied PNG and crowd comparison are preserved
  unchanged; `a-dot-shift` retains the original yellow-on-black single-dot PNG.
  The standalone generator preserves the Page algorithm and controls and opens
  with its saved settings; the current supplied image remains authoritative.
  PNG/SVG exports and controls were verified in Chrome. Package checks, 77 Python
  tests and 64 Node tests pass. No website catalogue route was added.

- 2026-10-26 website maintenance, **local production-build wiring**: OPS
  authorized local completion of the reviewed analytics candidate after its
  separate provider setup and bounded native diagnostic. Prepared an explicit
  production-only rebuild step in the existing Pages workflow, using future
  repository variables; ordinary local/CI/PR/preview builds remain off and the
  checked-in configuration stays disabled/unset. The consent module is unchanged.
  No live variable/provider mutation, commit/push/PR/merge, deployment or new
  Google request is authorized or performed. Native cross-domain settings,
  processed/filter-match evidence and hosted staging remain unqualified.
  The original candidate/evidence is preserved. See [build and release
  instructions](site/analytics.md); the new exact local handback is under
  ignored `local/qa/analytics-production-wiring/`. Local checks pass 64 Node
  tests, 77 Python tests and 12 isolated offline build cases. The default
  95-file artifact is byte-identical to the previous qualified candidate;
  synthetic enabled builds change only the inert HTML configuration. The
  reviewed consent module and its browser evidence remain unchanged.
  Next: OPS reviews this
  candidate and the remaining approval gates; no onward messages or timers.

- 2026-10-26 website maintenance, **local analytics preparation only**: prepared
  a small site-owned consent integration from main `57e55ef`. Configuration is
  disabled with no measurement ID; no Google SDK requests or measurement are
  authorized. The footer provides Analytics choices and browser exclusion;
  the locked manifesto, existing design, Protocol SDK, Agent exports and
  historical records remain unchanged. See the [candidate scope and release
  gates](site/analytics.md). Commit/push/PR, merge, provider setup, hosted
  staging, production deployment and enablement remain pending separate
  authorization. Local intercepted-tag checks cannot qualify the actual Google
  SDK or provider. Local checks pass 75 Python tests, 62 Node tests and 20
  intercepted stable-Chrome scenarios; the generated site remains 32 pages.
  No hosted staging destination is configured. Local QA and the exact candidate
  identity are retained under ignored `local/qa/analytics-candidate/`.
  Next: review that handback before approving any release or provider action;
  the previous documentation task is already merged in PR #17.

- 2026-10-26 website-maintenance documentation cleanup: current agent,
  contribution and site-maintenance instructions now describe the released
  v2 website rather than a pending preview. Dated additions in organization
  context and the Agent handoff collection supersede old website/private-SDK
  status without rewriting the original records. Historical study addenda,
  qualification reports, manifesto and design remain unchanged. The public
  reading SDK remains alpha; Inshell's release status is not inferred from
  this site's release. The operator authorized commit and push through the
  reviewed publication path; its PR records validation and deployment.
  The v2.0.0 tag stays fixed. Next: use the current release context for
  maintenance and retain dated observations as historical evidence.

- 2026-10-25 **stable v2.0.0 released**: the annotated tag and latest stable
  [GitHub release](https://github.com/agent-art-work/agentart.work/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
  point to `34eb92745d39e192f16719f7a6926784f697592d`, merged through
  [PR #15](https://github.com/agent-art-work/agentart.work/pull/15).
  [GitHub Pages deployment](https://github.com/agent-art-work/agentart.work/actions/runs/40187241940)
  succeeded. Release validation passed 70 Python and 35 Node tests, source
  packaging checks and site checks for 32 pages / 1,031 local links. All 92
  served files matched the build; all 24 Agent exports and three retained
  compatibility routes passed verification. Live stable Chrome at 1440px/light
  and 320px/dark confirmed top/footer navigation, preserved article fragments
  and no horizontal overflow or failed page requests; screenshots were inspected.
  The approved manifesto, design and historical records are unchanged.
  `codex/blog-footer-navigation` was deleted locally and remotely after merge.
  The website's stable designation does not promote the `0.1.5-alpha.2` SDK;
  reading compatibility retains one prior SDK and at most two prior reading
  integrations, not arbitrary old caches. No new receiving-app or artwork trial
  was performed. The operator requested this README/HANDOFF documentation update
  as a follow-up commit; keep the v2.0.0 tag fixed at the released revision.
  No release blocker remains. Next: maintain the stable site under the requested
  work lane; earlier local review/release instructions below are historical.

- 2026-10-25 operator authorized committing, pushing and deploying the top-bar
  Blog removal. Website-maintenance release scope is the reviewed navigation
  change below, with footer access and legacy fragments preserved. Require CI
  on the reviewed PR head, then verify Pages deployment and the live top/footer
  navigation. The release PR records the final deployment result; no content,
  design, SDK or historical-record revision is included.

- 2026-10-25 website maintenance, **local only**: removed Blog from the global
  top bar. It remains in the footer; pages, article URLs and historical records
  are unchanged. The legacy home `/#articles` fragment now reaches the footer's
  Blog link; `/blog/#articles` still reaches the feed. Top navigation is Agent
  Art, Protocol, Works, GitHub and X. All 16 existing Blog/page tests and the
  32-page / 1,031-link site check pass. Stable Chrome checks at 1440px and 320px
  confirm the five links, retained footer access and no horizontal overflow;
  screenshots inspected and owned QA browsers closed. Manifesto and design
  sources are unchanged. Preview is rebuilt at `http://127.0.0.1:8877/`.
  No commit, push or deployment for this change. Next: local operator review.

- 2026-10-25 operator authorized committing, pushing and deploying the cache
  compatibility changes and X links to agentart.work. Website-maintenance
  release lane: publish the reviewed candidate through a PR, require checks on
  its exact head, then verify the GitHub Pages deployment and live file bytes,
  legacy query routes, current module graph and Agent exports. The approved
  design, manifesto, invitation, SDK release and dependency lock stay unchanged.
  No live Agent Send or separate Protocol release is included. Earlier local-only
  entries below record completed preparation; the release PR records the final
  deployment outcome and evidence.

- 2026-10-25 website maintenance, **local only**: extended the existing
  `codex/sdk-cache-retention` change to resolve old HTML with a missing adapter,
  and old adapters with a missing Work. New adapter/Work URLs use SHA-256
  filenames. The legacy query URLs route only to the exact pinned snapshots
  from deployed `f41ca7f` and `122d703`; unknown hashes leave the manual prompt
  available. Reading retention is current plus at most two prior distinct
  integrations, coordinated with the current/previous SDK retention. See
  [site maintenance](site/README.md#reading-entries-across-an-upgrade) for
  snapshot identities, rotation and release checks. The earlier partial-cache
  limitation below is resolved for these retained graphs, not arbitrary old
  assets or bytes already cached incorrectly.
  Stable Chrome 156 passed all four selective-cache transitions (both releases,
  each with adapter+Work absent or Work alone absent), with actual HTML/cache
  evidence, matching SDK CSS/modules and exact invitation bytes. The fixture
  first reproduced old flat-label CSS with current alpha.2 JavaScript before
  applying the fix. Fresh 1440px/light and 320px/dark pages use only alpha.2;
  Copy/Copied dimensions, synthetic Copy, selected manual fallback, canceled
  native payloads and no-JavaScript fallback pass. Screenshots inspected.
  All 70 Python and 35 Node tests pass, including distinct old/new Work content,
  missing/mutated snapshots and rejected unknown hashes. Site checks pass for
  32 pages, 93 public files and 1,062 local links. Evidence is retained locally
  under `local/qa/mixed-cache/`; owned QA browsers, profiles and servers closed.
  Added the operator-supplied X handle `@AgentArt_work`: top and footer links, About link
  and shared `twitter:site` metadata. Design CSS, SDK/archive/lock, invitation,
  manifesto and historical records remain unchanged. **Uncommitted; no push,
  PR, merge, deployment or live Agent Send.** Independent local review found
  no blockers. The review preview is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8877/`;
  the served About page's X handle and immutable reading entry were verified.
  Next: local operator review.

- 2026-10-25 website maintenance, **local only** on
  `codex/sdk-cache-retention`: the build now retains one explicitly pinned
  predecessor SDK alongside current `0.1.5-alpha.2`. The deployed upgrade removed
  the `0.1.5-flat-label.1` paths; the Protocol maintainer reported a 404 for the
  old stylesheet with a 600-second cache lifetime. No user-visible failure was
  observed. Retention restores the five complete old browser files from the
  original 16,803-byte archive, SHA-256
  `be292abbca9f934dbc75e4bbe6f544011251043a75a89de608f8cbb8c60d02ea`,
  plus its unchanged README. It has no license file; the current SDK's MIT
  notice remains attached only to its own version. Package/lock, current SDK,
  design, invitation and manifesto are unchanged. See the bounded rotation
  policy and partial-cache limitation in [site maintenance](site/README.md#sdk-assets-across-an-upgrade).
  Stable Chrome 156 at 1440px verified actual disk-cache hits for old HTML,
  adapter and Work in a fresh tab, while all five old SDK files came over HTTP
  from the switched new build. A controlled missing-directory phase reproduced
  the old CSS/module 404s and retained the manual prompt. Fresh current HTML
  loaded only alpha.2. Both intact graphs mounted once and preserved exact
  synthetic Copy, selected manual fallback and canceled native URL payloads;
  no-JavaScript fallback also passed. Screenshots inspected. The fixture used
  SDK `no-store` responses to model selective cache absence, not ordinary
  eviction rates or a live user incident. Owned browser, profile and server
  closed; evidence retained locally under `local/qa/sdk-cache-transition/`.
  All 56 Python and 31 Node tests pass, along with source packaging and the
  32-page / 89-file / 1,062-link site check. A clean build of the deployed base
  confirms all 83 original output files remain byte-identical; the only six
  additions are the retained assets and README. Independent local review found
  no blockers within this scope.
  **No commit, push, PR, merge or deployment.** Next: review the local change;
  release needs separate authorization, then CI and HTTP byte verification of
  both SDK directories. Fixed-filename adapter cache misses remain a documented
  limitation, not solved by versioned SDK retention alone.

- 2026-10-24 SDK `0.1.5-alpha.2` rollout completed through
  [PR #13](https://github.com/agent-art-work/agentart.work/pull/13), merge
  `122d70350d0088001694dafef1e84c66ffc6f7a1`.
  [Deployment](https://github.com/agent-art-work/agentart.work/actions/runs/40094661246)
  succeeded. The release qualification recorded 82 served files matching the
  build, 24 verified Agent documents, seven canonical routes, and live stable
  Chrome checks at 1440px/light and 320px/dark. Earlier local-only integration
  notes below are retained history, superseded by this deployment result.

- 2026-10-24 operator authorized committing, pushing and deploying the verified
  SDK `0.1.5-alpha.2` integration to agentart.work. Publish through a reviewed
  website PR, require CI on the exact head, then verify the deployed browser
  assets, MIT notice, pages and Agent exports. Earlier local-only notes below
  describe completed preparation. No new live Agent trial or upstream SDK
  release is included. Deployment outcome is recorded on the release PR.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance: integrated public MIT SDK `0.1.5-alpha.2`
  locally, resolving the alpha.1 design blocker. The final published archive
  is 18,235 bytes, SHA-256
  `eadf80c14307b635bc69589b3a33ac747314b73fdef96cfb05f169337ffcc2b2`.
  Anonymous download, all 12 installed member hashes and a fresh offline locked
  install verified. Package/lock, adapter, immutable build paths, output
  allowlist and design record now use this version. The MIT notice is copied
  unchanged alongside all five browser assets. Protocol/Ask your Agent sources
  now describe the public alpha and its SDK-only license scope. No SDK internals
  or site theme CSS were overridden; the invitation and manifesto are unchanged.
  All 47 Python and 30 Node tests pass; 32-page / 83-file / 1,062-link site checks
  pass. Stable Chrome at 1440, 390 and 320px in light/dark passes flat geometry,
  equal visible gaps, Copy/Copied/reset size, exact context/native payloads,
  explanation link, hover rules/hints, keyboard, denied-copy and no-JS fallback.
  Four representative screenshots inspected. Initial hover measurement read
  child spans instead of their decoration-bearing parents; corrected the QA
  selector and all six cases passed. Native launches were canceled and clipboard
  outcomes simulated; no live Agent trial. Owned browsers/profiles and the
  temporary QA server were closed. Evidence is under ignored
  `local/qa/public-alpha-0.1.5-alpha.2/`.
  **Local only, uncommitted.** Production remains `v2.0.0-rc.1` on
  `0.1.5-flat-label.1`. Next: operator review, then a separately authorized
  website PR/rollout; no deployment or publication is authorized by this handoff.

- 2026-10-24 operator decision: retain the approved flat Ask your Agent design
  and request a compatible public Protocol release. The compatibility request,
  exact production/candidate versions, design contract and measured browser
  failures were sent to the existing `agent-art-protocol` session. Do not adopt
  the older alpha appearance. Next: inspect the compatible versioned archive
  and repeat local integration checks when available; deployment and live
  Agent Send remain outside this request.

- 2026-10-24 public reading alpha integration assessment, local only: production
  is verified at SDK `0.1.5-flat-label.1` (fresh home GET and UI/CSS byte checks).
  Protocol's handoff requests `0.1.5-alpha.1`; its exact 19,410-byte archive and
  all 12 packaged file digests match the published qualification. An isolated
  site candidate installs and locks that archive, copies its MIT notice into
  the public build and uses only documented theme hooks. All 47 Python and 29
  Node tests pass; site checks cover 32 pages, 83 files and 1,062 local links.
  Stable Chrome at 1440/light and 320/dark passes actual mount, exact context,
  canceled native routes, synthetic Copy/denial, stable feedback, explanation
  link, keyboard, theme and no-JavaScript fallback. Screenshots inspected.
  **Adoption is blocked by a design regression:** this alpha retains the older
  0.1.4 component, restoring frame/tail/icons and smaller type; equal visible
  action gaps fail in both viewports. Do not silently replace the approved flat
  design or override SDK internals. The active site/dependency remain unchanged.
  Candidate, patch, archive and evidence are retained under ignored
  `local/qa/public-alpha-0.1.5-alpha.1/`; its `report.json` identifies the isolated
  checkout. Next: obtain a compatible public flat-design release, or an explicit
  operator decision to adopt the older appearance. No new deployment or live
  Agent Send is authorized by this handoff. Owned test browsers/server closed.

- 2026-10-24 release completed: PR #12 merged as
  `f41ca7fe0e79083472d0bb86d974c71fbf62a4db`; `v2.0.0-rc.1` is published as a
  GitHub prerelease and deployed successfully. All 81 live public files matched
  the build; all 24 Agent documents passed identity/revision/byte/hash checks.
  Desktop/mobile browser checks passed. Earlier pending-release notes below
  describe the pre-release stage, not remaining release work.

- 2026-10-24 RC validation: a clean staged-source checkout passed packaging
  (39 documents, 183 links), all 47 Python and 29 Node tests, and the 32-page /
  82-file / 1,062-link site/export checks after a locked install with scripts
  disabled. The offline-cache attempt lacked one dependency; the normal locked
  install succeeded. Stable Chrome at 1440/light and 320/dark passed reading
  control geometry, exact synthetic Copy, feedback/reset, keyboard/hints,
  canceled native payload checks, denied-clipboard fallback and no-JavaScript
  access. Screenshots inspected; owned browsers/profiles cleaned. This is not
  a fresh receiving-app trial. The approved manuscript hash remains
  `7cce72483d34d7903a86a76620b9d3c3ac4c3880074e0f8e63679d8747406e61`.
  All 11 pinned SDK files match the installed package. Upstream's later .2
  experiment addresses pending optional discovery; this site's mount does not
  enable discovery, and its .1 bytes remain unchanged. Release awaits PR CI,
  merge, production deployment, tag and live verification.

- 2026-10-24 release authorization: prepare `v2.0.0-rc.1` for production through
  a reviewed PR and the existing Pages workflow. Bundle the already qualified
  SDK `0.1.5-flat-label.1` unchanged for this site; this does not publish an npm
  package, change Protocol repository visibility or select a reuse license.
  Local editorial drafts and unused SDK experiments stay untracked; preserve
  their historical references as local records. The approved manifesto snapshot
  is included for regression verification. Reconcile the repository-rename
  maintenance commit, validate a clean checkout, merge only passing CI, then tag
  the merged production revision and verify live page/export bytes. Deployment
  and tag outcome will be recorded in the GitHub prerelease and release report.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: centered the third Our logo
  mark horizontally beneath the paragraph, retaining its vertical position.
  Stable Chrome phone-width screenshot and geometry verified; build and site
  checks pass. Verifier browser closed. No commit, push or deployment.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: added a third mark in Our logo,
  beneath the paragraph near its left edge, preserving the preceding marks.
  Stable Chrome phone-width screenshot inspected: below text, zero grid error,
  no overflow. Build and site checks pass; verifier browser closed. No commit,
  push or deployment. Next: review the additional mark locally.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: added another grid-aligned logo
  inline within the Our logo paragraph, keeping existing marks. Stable Chrome
  phone-width screenshot inspected: two section marks, zero grid error, no
  overflow. Build/site checks pass; temporary verifier browser closed. No commit,
  push or deployment. Next: review the inline mark locally.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: renamed the About page title
  to About, moved “Our logo” to the end of its content, and explained stars and
  escape as imagery rather than an unexplained Astra name. Added a second mark
  centered between publication and tools sections, embedded in the page grid.
  The explanatory mark remains beside its paragraph. Previous heading anchors
  remain as aliases. Stable Chrome desktop/light and mobile/dark screenshots
  inspected; both marks align to the grid, no overflow or failed assets.
  Temporary verifier browsers closed. All 29 Node tests, packaging and site
  checks pass. No commit, push or deployment. Next: review About locally.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: About's Astra paragraph now
  includes the actual logo alongside its text, using shared grid-snapping and
  escaped-point masking. The Markdown source includes the image and alt text.
  Stable Chrome desktop/light and mobile/dark screenshots inspected: zero grid
  alignment error and no overflow in both views. Temporary Chrome sessions
  closed by the verifier. All 29 Node tests, packaging and site checks pass.
  No commit, push or deployment. Next: review the illustrated About section.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: added “An escape in the Astra”
  to About, describing the logo's points as part of the background grid and
  the amber-gold star escaping its place. Build, packaging and site/export
  checks pass. No commit, push or deployment. Next: review About's logo paragraph.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: replaced Site source in the
  shared footer with GitHub linking to the Agent Art Work organization, matching
  the top menu. About retains the website repository link. Build and site/export
  checks pass; footer change verified on all 31 shared-layout pages. No commit,
  push or deployment. Next: review the local footer.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: replaced About in the shared
  top menu with GitHub, linking to the Agent Art Work organization. About and
  Site source remain in the footer; logo destinations are unchanged. All 29
  Node tests and site/export checks pass. No commit, push or deployment.
  Next: review the updated top navigation locally.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: renamed the shared footer's
  GitHub link to “Site source”, retaining the website repository destination.
  Footer logo still links to the organization; top logo still links home.
  Build and site/export checks pass; all three destinations verified on all
  31 shared-layout pages. No commit, push or deployment. Next: local review.

- 2026-10-24 website-maintenance navigation/framing review, local only: reviewed
  all 32 generated page routes, active overview sources, research/collection
  framing, redirects and design demos. Removed the definition's duplicate
  Works/Blog continuation block and Protocol's repeated retrieval-guide link;
  tightened About's repeated ownership explanation. Research guidance,
  templates, findings and collections now have scoped page labels; collection
  headers identify retained records rather than current tasks/product status.
  Agent access explains discovery through metadata and Ask your Agent. The
  machine discovery introduction scopes provisional claims to research;
  design demos identify older treatments and 404 returns home. Retained source
  download/history links because they serve distinct provenance functions.
  All page URLs and 28 protected sources (manifesto, Guidance, historical
  records, research, templates, drafts and catalogue) remain unchanged.
  Validation: 29 Node tests, packaging and 32-page site/export checks pass.
  No live product claims were revalidated; no commit, push or deployment.
  Next: review the local definition, About and reference-page framing.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: removed Agent access and Document
  index (JSON) from the shared footer. Ask your Agent now carries both technical
  links under “For website authors”, labeled “Source retrieval and verification”
  and “Document index (JSON)”. The index link resolves within the preview/build;
  the handoff invitation still targets the published site. Access-guide source,
  URL, document identity, discovery metadata and downloads remain intact, as do
  the manifesto and historical project records. Navigation checks now verify
  index access directly or through Ask your Agent instead of requiring a footer
  link. Validation: 29 Node tests, 47 Python tests, packaging and site/export
  checks pass. No commit, push or deployment. Next: review the simplified footer
  and Ask your Agent technical references locally.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: removed Contribute from the
  shared footer and labeled the Blog feed's publishing link “Contribute an
  article”. The contribution guide and `/contribute/` URL are unchanged;
  contextual About and repository links remain. Updated navigation docs and
  assertions. All 29 Node tests, packaging and site/export checks pass;
  guide, manifesto and historical project source bytes are unchanged.
  No commit, push or deployment. Next: review the Blog publishing link locally.

- 2026-10-24 website maintenance, local only: removed Guidance from the shared
  footer. Current contextual links now say “Research guidance”; About describes
  its methods as optional for inquiries. The Guidance page, URL, source bytes
  and historical references remain intact, as does the locked manifesto.
  Updated current navigation/instruction documentation. Validation: 29 Node
  tests pass; packaging passes (49 documents, 228 links); site/export check
  passes (32 pages, 1,183 links). Checked every generated footer and confirmed
  27 protected source files unchanged. No commit, push or deployment. Next:
  review the local footer and About's contextual research link.

- 2026-10-24 website-maintenance packaging/navigation fix, local only: all 22
  previously reported packaging errors are resolved. The checker now excludes
  only the root ignored `local/` QA directory, rejects package links into it,
  and retains source size/count and disclosure checks. Relative `apps/home/`
  source paths no longer trigger the absolute-home-path detector. Two personal
  machine paths in the audit brief were replaced with portable checkout
  descriptions; observations and revisions remain intact. Local QA is untracked
  and retained. Historical project records, findings, research notes, templates,
  drafts, provenance, catalogue, manifesto and Agent index are byte-unchanged.
  Blog menu/return links and legacy listing redirects now open `/blog/` at the
  top. Existing `/blog/#articles` bookmarks still have their target. The only
  home HTML change is the Blog link destination; manifesto text is untouched.
  Validation: packaging PASS (49 documents, 228 links, zero errors), 47 Python
  tests, 29 Node tests, whitespace check and 32-page/1,214-link site/export check
  pass. Four stable Chrome click/redirect cases passed, including phone width;
  temporary browser profiles cleaned up. Preview restarted on port 8877 after
  the interrupted check. No commit, push or deployment. Next: review the local
  Blog navigation; any v2 release remains a separate authorized action.

- 2026-10-24 website-maintenance instructions cleanup, local only: AGENTS,
  README and this handoff now route work into website maintenance, Blog
  publishing or optional research. Routine site edits and ordinary articles
  no longer require Guidance, THOUGHT diagnostics, study intake or Lab-method
  evaluation. CONTRIBUTING and site maintenance link to the appropriate path;
  Guidance is explicitly optional. Ownership/boundary documents retain Lab as
  historical context and an inherited practice, without a separate standing
  programme. Earlier handoff directions are records, not an automatic queue.
  Historical project collections, findings, research notes, templates,
  provenance, article catalogue and locked manifesto are byte-unchanged from
  the start of this cleanup. All document identities/URLs and project export
  revisions are retained; generated home is unchanged. Validation: 29 Node
  tests, 40 Python tests, whitespace check and the 32-page/1,214-link site/export
  check pass. The same 22 pre-existing packaging errors remain (personal paths,
  missing local QA links and document-file bound). No commit, push or deployment.
  Next: continue the operator's chosen website or publishing task; address those
  packaging blockers separately before release. No Lab investigation is queued.

- 2026-10-24 Blog editorial/contribution lane, local only: framed the feed as
  a publication beginning with inherited Lab records, with links to maintained
  definition and Protocol pages. Updated stale handoff collection direction;
  appended dated later-development notes to the two October 4 articles without
  changing their earlier text. Scoped unresolved THOUGHT repair claims to the
  September 20 record; current product status was not revalidated. Original
  article dates, paths, document IDs and URLs remain intact; five other study
  sources, the locked manifesto and generated home are unchanged.
  CONTRIBUTING now offers agent/maintainer-assisted local drafting and direct PR
  submission. Publishing mechanics remain below the author-facing paths, with
  public draft-PR exposure explicit and ordinary writing free of mandatory study
  form. README, AGENTS, site maintenance and PR template agree. No CMS or new
  article storage model was introduced. Validation: 29 Node tests, 40 Python
  tests, 32-page/1,213-link source/export check and five stable Chrome cases pass
  (desktop/mobile, dark Blog and a dated article addition); owned profiles cleaned.
  Packaging still has the same 22 pre-existing errors involving personal paths,
  missing local QA links and the document-file bound. No commit, push or deploy.
  Next: operator review of local Blog and Contribute; resolve packaging blockers
  separately before release.

- 2026-10-24 removed About's duplicate “Read with your Agent” section.
  Ask your Agent remains the visitor entry; Agent access and Document index
  remain in every shared footer. Reviewed all 32 generated pages for competing
  reading labels: Protocol now names Ask your Agent directly, the technical
  guide is titled Agent access, and the no-JavaScript fallback uses the same
  Ask your Agent label with a link to its visitor explanation. The old design
  comparison is clearly marked as earlier studies, with current branding,
  Blog destinations and reading labels. Canonical invitation, SDK integration,
  locked manifesto and seven dated studies are unchanged. Generated documents
  match their revised sources. Validation: 29 Node tests, 40 Python tests,
  32-page/1,204-link site check and six stable Chrome checks pass, including
  mobile/dark and no-JavaScript fallback; no overflow or HTTP errors. Owned
  browser profiles cleaned up. Local only; next: operator review of About.

- 2026-10-24 shared footer now lists Agent Art, Protocol, Works, Blog, About,
  Ask your Agent, Guidance, Contribute, Agent access, Document index (JSON),
  then GitHub. Existing destinations are retained; Protocol, Blog and the
  Ask your Agent explanation are now directly available there. One continuous
  inline list wraps within the reading width; the top menu is unchanged.
  Validation: 29 Node tests and the 32-page/1,205-link site check pass; four
  stable Chrome desktop/mobile footer checks pass with no overflow or HTTP
  errors. Screenshots inspected and temporary browser profiles cleaned up.
  Local preview only. Next: operator review of the footer.

- 2026-10-24 regular-page body text is now 18px desktop / 16px mobile,
  keeping 1.65 line height. Home retains the manifesto's 22px / 18px type;
  shared frame, headings and navigation are unchanged. The manuscript and
  generated home HTML retain their hashes. The 32-page site check passes;
  stable Chrome verified eight page types at 1440px/light, 390px/light and
  320px/dark: 24 checks passed with expected font sizes and no overflow or HTTP
  errors. Desktop/mobile screenshots inspected; temporary browser profiles
  cleaned up. Local preview only. Next: operator review of regular-page density.

- 2026-10-24 corrected the Agent-index scope to exclude navigation-only listing
  pages and redirect wrappers, removing the obsolete claim that home is excluded.
  Rebuilt locally: only the generated index changed among the 82 public files;
  the homepage, manifesto export and locked manuscript are byte-identical.
  Validation: 29 Node tests, 40 Python tests and the 32-page/1,112-link site check
  pass. The package checker retains the same 22 pre-existing errors concerning
  personal paths, local QA links and its document-file bound. No commit, push
  or deployment. Next: review those separate packaging failures before release.

- 2026-10-23 footer links now form one continuous row on desktop, wrapping
  naturally on narrow screens. Retained all eight destinations and shared
  footer placement across the site. Local preview only.

- 2026-10-23 operator clarified that intention is the defining concern, while
  media, techniques, community and preservation are artist-chosen practices.
  Revised Agent Art to include painting without code/Protocol use and removed
  universal evidence/preservation demands. Artists decide whether and how to
  present evidence; audiences judge. Protocol is optional software infrastructure
  for digital interactions, not an artistic certifier or evidence authority.
  Updated Protocol, About, Guidance, Boundaries, intake instructions and ownership
  guidance consistently. Research and technical reporting standards remain
  scoped to their claims. The locked manifesto is unchanged. Inshell DEV applied the same
  clarification to its local candidate and regenerated exports; it reports
  88 docs/scroll tests plus 9 generator tests, type/drift/boundary/leak checks
  passing using the existing local toolchain. Here, all 29 Node tests and
  the 32-page source/export check pass. Both candidates remain local; exact
  Inshell dependency qualification and coordinated publication remain pending.
  Lane: website editorial/integration, local only; no SDK or runtime changes.

- 2026-10-23 cross-site documentation reconciliation, website editorial lane:
  removed Ask your Agent from the top menu; its control and explanation remain.
  Menu order is Agent Art, Protocol, Works, Blog, About. Reconciled the shared
  definition with Inshell's prior equality disclaimer: equal artistic standing
  and consequence are required, while roles, control and contribution size can
  differ. Expanded Agent Art's participation/execution and medium/method
  distinctions; retained the locked manifesto unchanged. Updated active
  Guidance, Boundaries, templates, About, access scope and THOUGHT collection
  orientation without rewriting dated study findings. Works now links to
  Inshell's current operating instructions rather than duplicating them.
  The [24-topic placement map](docs/ORGANIZATION_AND_SPLIT.md#documentation-placement-and-reconciliation-2026-10-23)
  records ownership, conflicts and coordinated release order.
  Inshell DEV completed its corresponding local authored/generated changes
  on `codex/docs-agent-art-work-reconciliation` from `1a44454` in an isolated
  checkout. Agent Art Work validation: 29 Node tests, 40 Python tests and the
  32-page site check pass. Regular Chrome verified eight page types at desktop
  and two phone widths, including dark mode, with no overflow or request errors;
  QA browser processes/profiles were removed. Local cross-site destination
  checks pass in both directions. These checks do not establish public v2
  availability. No SDK, artwork runtime, commit, push or deployment changes.
  Inshell's isolated candidate is at
  `/private/tmp/inshell-docs-agent-art-work-reconciliation`; its original dirty
  root checkout is preserved. Reviewed its authored definition, figures,
  glossary, lineage/method corrections and generated topics. DEV reports 87
  docs/scroll tests and 9 generator tests passed, with drift/type/boundary and
  leak checks passing; all 24 topic routes and 133 section IDs remain. Its
  desktop/mobile figure checks passed and temporary preview/dependency links
  were removed. Exact offline install lacked `@playwright/test@1.64.0`, so these
  checks used an existing toolchain and do not qualify a clean locked release.
  Historical art references remain attributed, not newly independently verified.
  Inshell candidate source-lock SHA-256:
  `5828a8dfdd2fce7a8e9497513c66b5bc63a68606427f6f53d51efc6b8602ec18`.
  Next: operator review of the two local candidates. Before any coordinated
  publication, verify a clean Inshell build with its pinned dependencies,
  release and verify Agent Art Work v2, then release Inshell's cross-site links
  under the respective release authorization.

- 2026-10-23 Works built in the local v2 preview at `/works/`, from canonical
  `docs/WORKS.md`. The showroom presents Inshell's THOUGHT as a current practice
  and WILL/AWA as studies, with artist attribution and links to their owning
  site. It is separate from Blog and included in the complete Agent document
  exports. Added shared navigation/footer links and routes from Agent Art/About.
  The THOUGHT visual is the unchanged SVG documentation example from
  `https://inshell.art/docs/thought.md`, explicitly labelled as an example,
  not a verified creation record or minted work. Local asset SHA-256:
  `467d7167138174d23882bf2f364bcf93ddfe276d6d330c18d1e535fda3ba0104`.
  The fetched AWA source also matches Inshell's published index digest.
  Validation: 29 Node tests, 40 Python tests, 32-page site check; alternate
  base-path navigation and complete source exports pass. Regular Chrome
  checked eight page types at 1440px/light, 390px/light and 320px/dark;
  no overflow, failed requests or logo alignment regressions. Owned QA Chrome
  processes/profiles were cleaned up. Lane: website design/integration only;
  no live artwork creation, minting, SDK change, push or deployment.
  Next: operator review of the showroom at `http://127.0.0.1:8877/works/`.

- 2026-10-23 operator clarified the source-of-truth boundary: Agent Art Work
  is the root of this initiative and owns its definition, manifesto, Protocol,
  shared tools and Works showroom. Inshell is the first builder artist and
  owns its "inspect self" practice and THOUGHT/WILL/AWA movements. Updated
  AGENTS, README, organization context, active Guidance and local About;
  historical source attribution and the locked manifesto remain intact.
  The primary Inshell DEV session acknowledged this replaces the earlier
  "two positions" framing and recorded it in its local MEMO. It identified
  pending reconciliation in its editorial instructions, Agent Art article,
  glossary and generated outputs; its public docs have not changed.
  Protocol SDK ownership stays in `agent-art-protocol`. Showroom placement
  transfers neither artwork ownership nor runtime/release responsibility.
  All 28 Node tests and the 31-page check pass; updated public sources have
  matching Agent-export bytes/hashes. Website editorial/integration, local
  only. Next: build the Works showroom with artist attribution and links to
  actual works; coordinate Inshell's general-doc alignment and v2 release links.

- 2026-10-23 shared footer links tidied: grouped About, Agent Art, Guidance,
  Contribute and GitHub separately from Agent access and Document index (JSON).
  Retained all seven destinations with shorter, consistent labels, fixed gaps,
  compact mobile columns and transparent surfaces. The identity/logo baseline
  is unchanged. All 28 Node tests and the 31-page check pass; regular Chrome
  verified seven page types at 1440px/light, 390px/light and 320px/dark, with
  no overflow, missing links or logo drift. Website design/integration, local
  only; next action: operator review of the footer.

- 2026-10-23 About tightened: led with the manifesto's field-building purpose,
  shortened the publication/tool map and consolidated Lab history. Preserved
  contribution and agent-access routes, separate project ownership and evidence
  limits. All four section anchors retained. All 28 Node tests and the 31-page
  check pass; exported source/download hashes match. Regular Chrome desktop/light
  and 320px/dark checks pass, with temporary browser profiles cleaned up.
  Website editorial/integration, local only; next action: operator review of
  `/about/`.

- 2026-10-23 Ask your Agent explanation tightened: clarified the site-wide
  invitation, published index, question/no-question paths, desktop links and
  Copy. Removed obsolete icon descriptions and inline SDK versions; retained
  app permissions, privacy, manual fallback and reading/participation limits.
  Explicitly notes that unpublished preview changes are unavailable through
  the handoff's published index. All 28 Node tests and the 31-page check pass;
  source/download hashes match, and regular Chrome desktop/light and 320px/dark
  checks pass. Manifesto and SDK unchanged. Website editorial/integration,
  local only; next action: operator review of `/ask-your-agent/`.

- 2026-10-23 Protocol overview tightened: centered its purpose on Agent
  contributions, consequences and evidence for audience judgment; separated
  available reading from the wider candidate participation design. Removed
  stale inline SDK/deployment versions in favor of the integration notes.
  Reviewed current owner sources and the site's installed package; no SDK,
  Protocol implementation or release changed. Existing heading anchors retained.
  Website editorial/integration, local only; next action: operator review of
  `/protocol/`.

- 2026-10-23 Agent Art definition page tightened against the locked manifesto:
  made human and Agent intentions consequential on equal artistic terms,
  centered what each seeks/adds and what becomes of it, and connected shared
  works to building the field. Consolidated repeated caveats while preserving
  learned intention, artistic freedom, audience judgment and Protocol's current
  limits. Exact opening definition and section anchors retained; manifesto and
  its lock unchanged. Website editorial/integration, local only; next action:
  operator review of `/agent-art/`.

- 2026-10-23 top navigation reordered site-wide: Agent Art, Protocol, Ask your
  Agent, Blog, About. Website design/integration, local only; next action:
  operator preview review.

- 2026-10-23 new logo applied site-wide: promoted the home grid mark to shared
  `assets/logo.svg` for headers, footers and browser icons. All shared-page marks
  use the locked 2px dots and align with the 10px background grid, preserving the
  transparent surface, amber escaped dot and bottom-row text alignment.
  All 28 Node tests and the 31-page check pass; regular Chrome verified seven
  page types at desktop/light and 320px/dark with no overflow or grid drift.
  Website design/integration, local only; next action: operator preview review.

- 2026-10-23 manifesto consolidated on home: removed its separate page and
  navigation/footer/contextual links. `/manifesto/` now redirects to `/` with a
  visible fallback. The source, stable document ID and complete download remain;
  the agent index identifies home as the canonical page. Manuscript unchanged.
  Validated 28 Node tests at root and project base paths, 40 Python tests and
  the 31-page site check. Regular Chrome desktop/mobile confirmed redirect,
  five-item navigation, all 14 paragraphs/four bold declarations and 2px logos.
  Public candidate packaging passes; the whole-folder checker still includes
  ignored local QA artifacts and exceeds its document limit.
  Website integration, local only; next action: operator review of the preview.

- 2026-10-23 logo-size tuning retired: removed the local slider and its stored
  preference handling. Both home marks use the fixed 2px dots from the SVG;
  background-grid alignment and text baselines remain unchanged. Local only;
  next action: operator review of the clean preview.

- 2026-10-23 approved manifesto revision integrated from the side conversation:
  the current lock is `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-23-locked-manifesto-v2.md`,
  identical to `docs/MANIFESTO.md` (2,798 UTF-8 bytes; SHA-256
  `7cce72483d34d7903a86a76620b9d3c3ac4c3880074e0f8e63679d8747406e61`).
  Closing: “Face another intention. Give this age a form.” The bold opening is
  canonical; removed the home-only emphasis wrapper. Prior snapshots preserved.
  Independent source/export review and regular Chrome desktop/mobile checks
  confirm all 14 paragraphs and four bold declarations on home and /manifesto/.
  Agent document source/download hashes and lengths match the regenerated index.
  All 27 Node tests and the 31-page check pass. Local preview only; next action:
  operator review at http://127.0.0.1:8877/ and /manifesto/ before any release.

- 2026-10-23 translucent Ask your Agent: replaced paper-mixed opaque amber
  surfaces with alpha tints through the SDK's public surface tokens. The dot
  texture now shows through both field and label; fallback panels retain their
  readable paper surface. Local only; next action: operator visual review.

- 2026-10-23 system-only appearance: removed the footer selector and manual
  theme overrides. The site always follows live OS light/dark settings, ignoring
  old stored preferences; print remains light. Local only; next: preview review.

- 2026-10-23 selected logo dots: both home logos now default to 2px diameter.
  Updated the SVG and local slider default; older preview slider preferences
  are superseded so the selected size appears on refresh. Grid centers and
  navigation/footer baselines are unchanged. Local only; next: preview review.

- 2026-10-23 footer alignment: the Agent Art Work link and adjacent desktop
  slogan now share the center line of the logo's bottom dot row, independent
  of dot size. Mobile retains its stacked slogan. Verified on home and a regular
  page at 1440/390/320px in regular Chrome; alignment error <0.1px. Local only;
  next action: operator visual review.

- 2026-10-23 menu alignment correction: navigation now follows the center line
  of the logo's bottom dot row, not the circles' outer edge. Changing dot size
  leaves the menu baseline fixed. Local only; next action: operator review.

- 2026-10-23 local logo-size handle: a bottom-right slider on the local homepage
  adjusts both logo dot diameters from 2–6px (0.1px steps, initially 4px).
  It remembers the preview setting, keeps dot centers fixed, and realigns the
  menu baseline to the changed dot edge. Available on loopback/private LAN
  hosts only, hidden in print. Regular Chrome desktop/mobile verified slider
  endpoints, shared updates and reload persistence in `local/qa/logo-slider/`.
  Local only; next action: operator choose the final dot diameter.

- 2026-10-23 transparent links and masthead alignment: removed ordinary link
  backgrounds so the dot field continues behind them. Shared `masthead.js`
  measures the navigation baseline against the visible logo's bottom dots,
  including the home grid snap, font loading and resizing. At mobile widths,
  the second navigation row follows that baseline. Regular Chrome verifies
  <0.1px alignment at 1440/390/320px on home and a regular page, with transparent
  link fills and no overflow. Local only; next action: operator visual review.

- 2026-10-23 tighter shared grid: background spacing is now 10px, with both
  home logos scaled to match (40px canvases). A shared CSS spacing variable
  controls the texture, logo size and vacated-dot mask. Local only; next: review.

- 2026-10-23 smaller home logo dots: reduced their rendered diameter from 6.6px
  to 4.8px, preserving 12px grid alignment and the escaped position. Local only;
  next action: operator preview review.

- 2026-10-23 home grid-logo experiment: both home logos now share the background's
  12px grid. Eight enlarged dots cover existing grid dots; a small paper-colored
  mask removes the ninth dot's original position beneath the amber escape.
  Marks use 48px SVG canvases and snap to the document grid on layout/resize.
  Other pages and the favicon retain their existing mark sizes. Local only.
  Regular Chrome desktop/mobile geometry and screenshots checked in
  `local/qa/grid-logos/`; next action: operator review of the integrated marks.

- 2026-10-23 denser background: reduced the shared dot-grid spacing from 16px
  to 12px in both themes, retaining dot size and opacity. Local preview only.
  Next action: operator visual review.

- 2026-10-23 appearance modes restored: shared pages default to system light/dark,
  with a footer Appearance selector for System / Light / Dark. Explicit choices
  persist across pages and synchronize across tabs. Theme applies before paint;
  storage denial is tolerated, CSS follows the system without JS, print stays
  light. Logo, dots, navigation and Ask your Agent use the effective theme.
  27 Node tests and 31-page link checks pass. Regular Chrome desktop/mobile
  verifies overrides, persistence, live OS changes, reset, denied storage and
  no-JS/print fallbacks; screenshots in `local/qa/theme-switch/`.
  Local only; next action: preview the Appearance control in the footer.

- 2026-10-23 menu optical alignment: align the actual PT Mono text baseline
  with the bottom of the logo dots, correcting the prior container alignment.
  Measured offsets are 7px desktop / 5.8px mobile. Right alignment is retained.
  Local only; next action: preview review.

- 2026-10-23 homepage footer unified: home now uses the regular pages' Ask your
  Agent utility and branded reference footer. The duplicate bottom primary
  menu is removed; the legacy #articles anchor moves to the top Blog link.
  Manifesto text remains unchanged. Local only; next action: preview review.

- 2026-10-23 top-bar alignment: primary menus are grouped against the right
  edge, with their bottom edge aligned to the logo. Mobile retains two rows.
  Local only; next action: preview review.

- 2026-10-23 transparent logo: removed the SVG background rectangle, retaining
  the nine Off grid dots and amber escaped dot. Updated its asset version so
  preview browsers load the transparent mark. Shared header, footer and favicon
  use the same asset. Local only; next action: preview review.

- 2026-10-23 global top bar: one shared logo-only header across home and inner
  pages. The Off grid mark sits left of Manifesto, Agent Art, Blog, Protocol,
  Ask your Agent and About; its accessible home label is retained without a
  visible brand name. Mobile keeps two compact link rows beside the mark.
  Home retains its approved entrance animation; GitHub remains in About/footer.
  Validation: 27 Node tests, all 31 page link checks, and regular Chrome
  checks on 11 routes at 1440/800/390/320px pass. Screenshots and geometry
  evidence: `local/qa/global-top/`. Local only; next: desktop/phone review.

- 2026-10-23 manifesto participation ending: integrated the operator-approved
  two paragraphs beginning “The encounter does not end with its makers” and
  “Make these encounters available”, replacing the former penultimate paragraph.
  Earlier paragraphs and the final bold refrain are unchanged. Current locked
  snapshot: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-23-locked-manifesto.md`; the older
  snapshot is retained. Home, /manifesto/ and agent exports use the same source.
  All 27 Node tests and the 31-page link check pass; local and LAN HTTP checks
  confirm the updated home and /manifesto/. Local only; next action: operator
  review of the complete flow in the preview.

- 2026-10-23 shared reading style (website design/integration): mobile primary
  navigation uses two compact rows of three links. All shared pages now use PT
  Mono, white dotted paper, black text, 22px desktop / 18px mobile reading text,
  60ch columns and 1.65 line height. Header/footer and reading utilities align
  with the content. Existing articles, references and SDK controls are retained.
  27 Node tests and 31-page link checks pass. Regular Chrome checks 11 routes
  at desktop, 390px and 320px: typography, two-row mobile navigation and no
  overflow pass (`local/qa/shared-reading/`). Local only; next action: operator
  phone review on the LAN preview.

- 2026-10-23 PT Mono selected (website design/integration): the homepage now
  self-hosts the selected regular face with its OFL license. Bold remains browser
  synthesized as in the comparison. The font panel is removed; do not rerun its
  archived injection script. Reading settings stay 22px desktop / 18px mobile,
  60ch and 1.65. Build/link checks pass; regular Chrome verifies the actual PT
  Mono font, absent panel and no overflow at 1440px, 390px and 320px. Evidence:
  `local/qa/pt-mono-selected/`. Local only. Next: operator review at port 8877.

- 2026-10-23 reading typography (website design/integration): homepage now uses
  22px desktop / 18px mobile, 60ch maximum width and 1.65 line height. Navigation
  stays aligned with the reading column. The local font panel uses these defaults
  and resets older saved sizes once for this preset, preserving font and weight.
  Build/link checks pass; regular Chrome verifies actual sizes, line height,
  column alignment and no overflow at 1440px, 390px and 320px. Evidence:
  `local/qa/manifesto-reading/`. Local preview only; next action: operator reading
  review at port 8877.

- 2026-10-23 pixel-based font sizing: the local panel now sets and displays
  actual body size in pixels (16–36px, 1px steps), with proportional title and
  navigation scaling. Reset uses 24px desktop / 20px narrow-screen defaults;
  saved percentage settings migrate to pixel values. Long words wrap at large
  sizes on mobile. Weight and font controls are retained. QA evidence:
  `local/qa/typewriter-pixels/`. Next action: operator tuning in local preview.

- 2026-10-23 font panel tuning: added Font size (80–130%, 5% steps) and Weight
  (regular 400 / bold 700) knobs to the existing local-only panel. Size scales
  title, body and primary navigation together; responsive column sizing follows
  the body. Emphasis remains 700. These static fonts have no continuous weight
  range; Cutive Mono / PT Mono simulate bold as disclosed. Font, size and weight
  persist locally; Reset all restores Courier New / 100% / 400. Reapplied via
  `node local/design/typewriter-fonts/apply-preview.mjs`; no production changes.
  Regular Chrome desktop/mobile checks pass all four faces at both size/weight
  extremes, proportional title scaling, no overflow, keyboard, persistence and
  combined reset. Evidence: `local/qa/typewriter-tuning/`. Next: operator tuning
  at http://127.0.0.1:8877/.

- 2026-10-23 local typewriter font comparison (website design/integration):
  the real home at port 8877 now has a collapsible bottom-right panel with
  Courier New (current), Courier Prime, Cutive Mono and PT Mono. Switching
  updates homepage typography; Reset restores Courier New, and a localhost
  storage key retains the local choice. Mobile starts collapsed. Cutive Mono
  and PT Mono use simulated bold, explicitly noted in the panel. The three
  alternative faces are locally served, unmodified Google Fonts files with
  retained OFL licenses and source/hash records. All panel files are ignored
  under `local/design/typewriter-fonts/`; production sources have no panel.
  To restore after any build: `node local/design/typewriter-fonts/apply-preview.mjs`.
  A normal build removes the panel and local font assets from `_site`.
  Normal build: 27 Node tests and 31-page / 1,017-link check pass. After local
  injection, regular Chrome at 1440px and 320px verifies four distinct actual
  rendered fonts, fixed character widths, title/body consistency, bold, fit,
  persistence/reset and keyboard selection; no external browser requests.
  Evidence: `local/qa/typewriter-fonts/`. Owned browser processes cleaned up.
  Next action: operator font comparison at http://127.0.0.1:8877/; no publication.

- 2026-10-23 intro timing adjusted: pause is now 1 second, followed by the
  unchanged 700ms scroll. Local build verified; next action: preview review.

- 2026-10-23 intro pause increased: top navigation now stays still for 1.8
  seconds before the existing 700ms smooth movement. Desktop/mobile browser
  samples confirm the pause, intermediate movement and completion; evidence:
  `local/qa/manifesto-intro-pause/`. Next action: fresh local homepage review.

- 2026-10-23 homepage entrance animation: fresh top-of-page visits show the
  navigation for 650ms, then scroll its height over 700ms, leaving the title
  visible. Navigation stays in normal flow and can be reached by scrolling up.
  User wheel/touch/pointer/key input interrupts; hash links, history returns,
  restored offsets, focused controls and reduced motion prevent the animation.
  No-JavaScript behavior is unchanged. `site/assets/home-intro.js` is loaded
  only on home and added to the public asset allowlist. 27 Node tests and
  31-page / 1,017-link checks pass. Regular Chrome at desktop/mobile verifies
  initial visibility, intermediate motion, final position, return to the bar,
  cancellation before/during motion, fragment position, reduced motion and
  no-JS behavior. Evidence: `local/qa/manifesto-intro/`; owned processes cleaned
  up. Next action: reload the local homepage to review. No deployment.

- 2026-10-23 flush navigation: both primary link rows offset their 12px label
  padding so the first visible link text aligns exactly with the manifesto's
  left edge. Padding remains intact. Desktop/mobile geometry and screenshots
  pass in `local/qa/manifesto-flush-links/`. Next action: local preview review.

- 2026-10-23 homepage reference cleanup: both navigation dividers are removed;
  the bottom reference row is removed from home. All six reference destinations
  remain accessible in About content: Guidance, Contribute, agent access,
  document index, GitHub organization and source/history. Top and bottom retain
  six primary links; the reading component remains at the bottom. The site
  checker accepts home → About → document index while other pages still require
  a direct visible index link. Agent index metadata remains in the home head.
  27 Node tests, 40 Python tests and 31-page / 1,016-link checks pass, alongside
  desktop/mobile visual checks in `local/qa/manifesto-primary-links/`.
  Next action: local preview review. No commit, push or deployment.

- 2026-10-23 white navigation labels: top and bottom primary link backgrounds
  are now white, including hover; hover uses an underline for feedback. Padding
  remains 4px / 12px. Ask your Agent retains its approved amber appearance.
  Local build and desktop/mobile browser checks pass; evidence:
  `local/qa/manifesto-white-links/`. Next action: local preview review.

- 2026-10-23 white homepage and matched navigation padding: primary navigation
  labels now use 4px vertical / 12px horizontal padding, matching Ask your Agent.
  Homepage paper is pure white (#FFF); dot texture and black text remain.
  Local build and regular Chrome desktop/mobile checks verify the rendered
  background and matching computed padding. Evidence:
  `local/qa/manifesto-white-padding/`. Next action: local preview review.

- 2026-10-23 logo addition reverted at operator request. The homepage top
  area is back to the six primary navigation links without a logo. Other
  manifesto layout and navigation changes are retained. Local preview only.

- 2026-10-23 homepage logo: restored the existing Off grid Agent Art Work
  mark at the top left, linked home with an accessible label. It sits beside
  navigation on desktop and above it on narrow screens, on the same column
  edge as the manifesto. Local build, tests and desktop/mobile visual checks
  pass; evidence: `local/qa/manifesto-logo/`. Next action: local preview review.

- 2026-10-23 navigation simplification: removed both visible “Links” labels
  and the reference-link row from the top. The six main links remain at top;
  the bottom retains all twelve destinations and the reading button. Column
  alignment and warm background are unchanged. Node and site checks pass;
  desktop/mobile browser evidence: `local/qa/manifesto-nav-cleanup/`.
  Next action: review the local preview; no publication.

- 2026-10-23 repeated Links navigation (website design/integration): matching
  groups labelled “Links” now appear above and below the manifesto. Their
  containers use the same 62ch measure and responsive gutters as the text.
  All 12 navigation/reference destinations are repeated; the reading control
  remains at the bottom, and the legacy articles anchor remains unique there.
  Warm paper, dots and black text are unchanged. 27 Node tests and the
  31-page / 1,022-link check pass; stable Chrome desktop/mobile measurements
  and screenshots confirm both groups align with the reading column.
  Evidence: `local/qa/manifesto-links/`; owned browser processes cleaned up.
  Next action: local preview review. No commit, push or deployment.

- 2026-10-23 centered manifesto: title and body now share one centered 62ch
  reading column on the homepage, preserving left-aligned text within it.
  Local build and desktop/mobile browser geometry checks pass; evidence is in
  `local/qa/manifesto-centered/`. Next action: review the local preview.

- 2026-10-23 homepage typography refinement (website design/integration):
  title is now “Agent Art Manifesto”; the opening sentence is a bold paragraph,
  matching the three existing emphatic turns. Homepage manifesto uses exactly
  three type styles: title, bold and regular. All homepage text is black; the
  homepage retains light paper in both system themes for legibility. Inner
  pages keep their existing theme. Canonical manuscript wording is unchanged;
  emphasis is applied at render time. 27 Node tests and 31-page / 1,012-link
  checks pass. Desktop/light and mobile/dark-system browser checks confirm
  three computed type styles, black text, layout and reading controls.
  Evidence: `local/qa/manifesto-black-type/`. Local preview only, same branch;
  next action is operator review at http://127.0.0.1:8877/.

- 2026-10-23 complete-manifesto homepage experiment (website design/integration):
  operator requested a new branch; `codex/manifesto-home` carries the existing
  uncommitted v2 work and this redesign. Home renders the full locked manuscript
  directly from `docs/MANIFESTO.md`, promoting its opening paragraph to h1.
  No homepage header, section cards or former branded footer remain. A new
  bottom section holds all previous navigation destinations and the site-wide
  Ask your Agent control. Existing `/#articles` links land on the Blog link;
  internal pages keep their header/footer. Manifesto wording, paragraph order
  and all three bold turns are unchanged. Amber-gold and flat-label settings
  remain locked. Ports 8876/8877 serve the rebuilt `_site`; no deployment.
  Validation: 27 Node tests, 39 Python tests, 31 pages / 1,012 local links pass.
  Stable Chrome at 1440px/light and 320px/dark verified the full layout,
  bottom navigation, no overflow, exact Copy, stable inline feedback, equal
  action gaps, keyboard/hints, native URL payloads (activation canceled),
  denied-clipboard fallback and no-JavaScript prompt. Screenshots and reports:
  `local/qa/manifesto-home/`. Owned headless processes/profiles were cleaned up.
  Next action: operator review at http://127.0.0.1:8877/. No commit or push.

- 2026-10-23 amber-gold + flat-label integration complete (website lane):
  operator locked amber-gold and the approved button design into v2. Both
  ports 8876 and 8877 now serve the real `_site` build; the tuning desk and its
  visual-only actions are no longer served. Logo, primary accents and component
  use #A87632 light / #D9B66F dark. Source record: `site/ask-your-agent-design.json`.
  Protocol-owned local candidate `0.1.5-flat-label.1` is pinned from its immutable
  vendor archive; SHA-256 `be292abbca9f934dbc75e4bbe6f544011251043a75a89de608f8cbb8c60d02ea`. Public theme hooks only;
  all packaged files were verified and core reading/client APIs are unchanged.
  A wrapped mobile-row spacing defect found during integration was corrected
  by the Protocol owner in this fresh candidate. Browser checks at 1440px/light
  and 320px/dark passed exact Copy, inline feedback/reset with stable outer size,
  all four equal gaps including field edges, keyboard, native URL contents
  (activation canceled), denial fallback and no-JS access. No fresh app trial.
  All 27 Node tests and 31-page/1,026-link/document checks pass. Evidence:
  `local/qa/v2-flat-label/`. Locked manifesto bytes are unchanged. No commit,
  push or deployment; next action is operator review of the v2 local preview.

- 2026-10-23 amber-gold brand trial: isolated preview at port 8877 now uses
  #A87632 in light mode / #D9B66F in dark mode for the escaped logo dot,
  site accents (including the home hero and sticker links), and the button.
  Approved spacing, typography and 15%/30% tints are retained. The desk adds an
  Amber gold palette and uses a separate preview storage key. The canonical
  Graphite lock in `site/ask-your-agent-design.json` remains the approved baseline;
  this brand-color proposal is not a deployment or Protocol SDK change.
  Next: operator inspect both appearances and choose the primary color.

- 2026-10-23 operator locked the local flat-label design. Canonical record:
  `site/ask-your-agent-design.json`. Graphite, system appearance, 4px vertical,
  12px label horizontal padding, 12px minimum action gaps, 14px type, 15% whole
  tint, 30% label tint, square corners. No icons/frame/tail; retain the approved
  hover hints, underlines and inline Copied behavior. Port 8877 defaults and
  Reset now use these values under a fresh settings-storage revision. This is
  a local prototype approval, not an SDK release or deployment. The separate
  umbrella primary-color choice is still open; amber-gold is a proposal only.
  Next: choose the brand color, then integrate via the Protocol-owned component.

- 2026-10-23 tuning desk refinement (website design prototype lane): port 8877
  restores a separate 0–100% label-tint control for only “Ask your Agent”
  (default 15%), alongside whole-button tint. Palette now has twelve choices:
  Clay, Slate, Sage, Mauve, Ochre, Rose, Coral, Plum, Indigo, Teal, Moss, Graphite.
  Existing saved choices are retained; the new setting saves and resets too.
  Regular Chrome desktop/light and phone/dark checks verified independent tint,
  twelve distinct palettes, persistence/reset and no horizontal overflow.
  Evidence: `local/qa/flat-label-colors/`. Local prototype only; main SDK unchanged.
  Follow-up: removed the Copy and information icons in the prototype; left-aligned
  Copy inside its reserved feedback width. Chrome measured equal 6px text gaps
  between ChatGPT/Claude/Copy on desktop and phone, exact synthetic prompt Copy,
  and zero width shift on “Copied”. Screenshots: `spacing-*.png` in the QA folder.
  Latest refinement: removed the button dot and its size control from the local
  prototype; the site logo is unchanged. Rebuilt and checked generated markup.
  Action links now underline by default and remove the underline on hover.
  Copy decorates only its text, with the same 1px thickness and 3px offset as
  ChatGPT/Claude. Real Chrome pointer checks passed for all three actions;
  screenshot: `local/qa/flat-label-colors/underlines.png`.
  “Ask your Agent” itself now underlines only on hover, matching the action
  underline thickness/offset; the other three retain the inverse hover behavior.
  Restored native hover titles from SDK wording for the label, both clients and
  Copy. Client titles additionally identify this desk as a non-launching preview.
  Rebuilt and checked all eight title attributes across both button instances.
  Removed the Copy label’s reserved 6ch width, which left excess right space.
  Copy now keeps its label and shows a floating “Copied” confirmation for 3s.
  Chrome verified exact 8px trailing padding at the pictured setting, exact
  synthetic Copy and zero width shift. QA: `compact-copy.png` in the same folder.
  Operator correction: floating confirmation is removed. Copy/Copied now share
  the natural width of “Copied”, centered so spare room is distributed evenly.
  Chrome verified inline feedback, automatic reset and zero width change.
  Current evidence: `local/qa/flat-label-colors/inline-copied.png`.
  Latest spacing correction: actions form a separate evenly spaced row, including
  both outer edges. A hidden, aria-hidden sizing row reserves the natural width
  of Copied; extra space is distributed across all four gaps in the Copy state.
  Label horizontal padding is separate; action spacing sets the minimum four gaps.
  Desktop/light and phone/dark Chrome measurements match within 0.02px in both
  states, with zero button-width change. QA: `equal-gaps*.png` in the same folder.
  Next: operator tune and select the design.

- 2026-10-22 compact button tuning desk (website design prototype lane): a
  separate local desk at `http://127.0.0.1:8877/` shows the current real homepage
  with a site-owned button prototype at 1px vertical / 4px horizontal padding.
  Nine controls tune padding, spacing, type size, background tint, radius, dot,
  palette and appearance; Reset and Copy settings are available. Choices persist
  in that preview origin. Source: `local/design/flat-label-2026-10-22/`.
  ChatGPT/Claude links are visibly labelled visual previews and do not launch;
  Copy uses the canonical invitation. Desktop/light and phone/dark checks passed
  knob changes/reset, exact synthetic Copy, settings Copy and zero overflow.
  Evidence: `local/qa/flat-label-desk/`. The actual SDK has no public density hook;
  its fixed sizing and the main integration at port 8876 remain unchanged.
  Next: operator tune/review, then implement the chosen density through the
  Protocol-owned component rather than overriding private SDK internals.

- 2026-10-22 flat Ask your Agent (website design/integration lane): replaced
  the visible bubble frame and tail with one rectangular Clay-tinted field.
  The site uses documented SDK theme hooks on its mount: transparent frame,
  label surface and idle underline; 22% Clay action surface; zero radius.
  SDK files, prompt and handoff behavior are unchanged. The design record and
  maintenance notes reflect this new local treatment.
  Validation: 27 Node tests and 31-page checks passed. Regular Chrome at 1440px
  light and 320px dark verified the invisible frame/tail, continuous background,
  no overflow, exact synthetic Copy, stable feedback, keyboard focus,
  denied-clipboard selection and no-JS fallback. Native activation was canceled.
  QA: `local/qa/flat-reading/`; owned Chrome processes/profiles were cleaned up.
  Local preview only at port 8876; next action is operator design review.

- 2026-10-22 homepage sticker links (website design/integration lane): the
  manifesto link and six section actions use compact Clay-tinted backgrounds
  with the operator's minimal 1px vertical / 4px horizontal padding and no arrows
  instead of underlines, with a stronger fill on hover and retained focus rings.
  Build and regular Chrome desktop/phone checks passed: seven filled links,
  no clipping or overflow, correct light/dark colors. QA: `local/qa/sticker-links/`.
  Local preview only; next action is operator review.

- 2026-10-22 concise home sections (website design/integration lane): Agent
  Art, Blog and Protocol descriptions are 28px on desktop and 24px on mobile;
  their three smaller annotations and section eyebrows were removed.
  Section headings retain their links with no arrows; main wording remains.
  Build and 31-page checks passed. Regular Chrome desktop/phone checks confirm
  the sizes, zero annotations and no overflow. QA: `local/qa/concise-sections/`.
  Local preview only; next action is operator review.

- 2026-10-22 Clay hero (website design/integration lane): the home manifesto
  sentence uses the icon's existing Clay accent in light and dark mode.
  Print retains the ink color. Build and regular Chrome visual checks passed;
  both screen colors match the icon, with no overflow. QA: `local/qa/clay-hero/`.
  Existing Chrome preview refreshed; local only. Next: operator visual review.

- 2026-10-22 shared reading control (website design/integration lane): removed
  the homepage “Agent Art Manifesto” label and “Art belongs in the middle of
  it” subtitle; “Read the manifesto” is right-aligned beneath the opening.
  The locked full manifesto is unchanged. Ask your Agent now lives above the
  footer on every standard page, outside the page content. Its unchanged Work
  and canonical invitation address the entire public document index, not the
  manifesto or the currently viewed page. The shared no-JS fallback and
  `#reading-heading` target are retained. The explanation documents this scope.
  Validation: 27 Node tests passed, including shared placement and exact prompt
  checks; 31 pages and 1,026 local links passed site checks. Regular Chrome
  desktop, tablet and phone checks found no horizontal overflow. Exact Copy,
  feedback stability, keyboard focus, denied clipboard and no-JS fallback
  passed; the manifesto page independently mounted the shared control.
  Native activation was canceled and clipboard writes were synthetic. QA:
  `local/qa/site-reading/`; owned Chrome processes and profiles were cleaned up.
  Local preview only at `http://127.0.0.1:8876/`; next action is operator review.

- 2026-10-22 full-width home hero (website design/integration lane): the
  manifesto opening now spans the home content width. Its wording is unchanged.
  Ask your Agent is the compact SDK control beside “Read the manifesto,”
  wrapping below it on small screens; explanatory copy was removed from home.
  The static canonical prompt stays available when JavaScript or the SDK is
  unavailable, and hides only after a successful mount. Host sizing accounts
  for the SDK's size containment; no SDK internals were changed.
  Validation: 27 Node tests passed; site checks covered 31 pages and 910 local
  links without errors. Regular Chrome checks at 1440px, 900px and 320px found
  no horizontal overflow. Desktop light and phone dark checks passed exact
  copy, stable feedback, keyboard focus, denied-clipboard selection and no-JS
  fallback. Native activation was canceled and clipboard writes were synthetic.
  QA is under `local/qa/wide-hero/`; disposable Chrome profiles were removed.
  Preview remains `http://127.0.0.1:8876/`, local and unpublished.
  Next action: operator review of the wider hero and compact reading control.

- 2026-10-22 locked manifesto and site integration (website design/integration
  lane): the operator approved the latest complete text, including the bold
  “We make Agent Art from this encounter,” and requested local v2 integration.
  [MANIFESTO](docs/MANIFESTO.md) and the
  locked snapshot (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-22-locked-manifesto.md`)
  are byte-identical to the approved manuscript (2,254 UTF-8 bytes; SHA-256
  `ab8cd057e05ace27faa791ba6870f30828e1441f16652197ef2ee64f0a2ec62d`).
  The home now leads with its opening; `/manifesto/` carries the complete text
  without an outline. `/agent-art/` carries the separate
  [definition and explanation](docs/AGENT_ART.md), with collapsible contents.
  Navigation, overview and README express the publication split. Existing
  article routes, stable schema identifiers and SDK files remain unchanged.
  Both new sources are included in the complete agent exports.
  Validation: 27 Node tests and 39 Python tests passed; site checks cover 31
  pages and 911 local links with no errors. HTTP checks fetched and verified
  all 23 exported documents and recomputed the index revision. Regular Chrome
  checks found zero horizontal overflow and no failed requests on the home,
  manifesto and definition at desktop and phone widths. The existing reading
  controls passed light/dark checks at 1440px and 320px, including stable copy
  feedback, exact context, keyboard focus, denied-clipboard selection and
  no-JavaScript fallback. Native app activation was canceled; these are local
  integration checks, not a receiving-app trial. QA is under
  `local/qa/manifesto-v2/`; disposable Chrome profiles were removed.
  The whole-tree packaging scan still flags personal paths in two pre-existing
  ignored QA JSON files (`local/qa/button-polish/baseline.json` and
  `local/qa/v2/final-content-check.json`); neither enters generated output.
  Preview server: `http://127.0.0.1:8876/`. The existing regular Chrome preview
  tab was refreshed and shown; no new user tabs were created or closed.
  Next action: operator review of the site hierarchy and reading experience.
  No commit, push or deployment. The reading invitation still points to the
  published domain; its new documents become available there only upon release.

- 2026-10-22 candidate reconciliation (website editorial lane): the main chat
  received the formal candidate and compared it with the operator's latest
  writing-view snapshot. The working manuscript (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`)
  now incorporates the six accepted wording changes while retaining the
  snapshot's added question, “What does it value?”, and its unbolded Agent Art
  introduction. The formal candidate file is preserved unchanged. Next action:
  continue editorial review from the reconciled working manuscript. Local
  draft only; no publication or deployment.

- 2026-10-22 formal manifesto candidate (website editorial lane): the operator
  accepted all six editorial suggestions in the side conversation and asked
  to pass the result to the main chat as a formal candidate. The
  accepted candidate (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-22-formal-candidate.md`)
  preserves the complete manuscript with those six changes only, including
  “We make Agent Art from this encounter” and the experience–examine–question
  closing progression. The working manuscript remains unchanged by this
  handoff. Next action: the main website maintainer takes this candidate
  forward in the manifesto discussion. It remains local and unpublished.

- 2026-10-22 Agent Art ending (website editorial lane): the operator found
  the closing invitations too generic. The manifesto (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`)
  now returns to its sentence/Agent-answer and image/Agent-choice examples,
  with audience judgment tied to actual contribution and consequence.
  Earlier paragraphs and final refrain are unchanged. Next action: operator
  review of this ending; the manuscript remains a local, unpublished draft.

- 2026-10-22 situation before Agent Art (website editorial lane): the operator
  clarified that fear matters deeply, while consolation and hype are not this
  manifesto's purpose. Describe the situation first, identify thinking power
  as the challenge, bring Agent intentions into view to inspect and understand,
  then introduce Agent Art. The revised manifesto (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`)
  preserves the original opening exactly and follows that sequence. The
  companion (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/agent-art.md`) retains definition and
  explanation, with observation limits clarified. Earlier supremacy slogans
  are not a requirement to reinsert them into the manifesto. Exact opening
  preservation, narrative order, Markdown rendering and local links passed.
  Next action:
  operator review of the full text and its progression. Local drafts only;
  public sources, v2 preview and Protocol implementation are unchanged.

- 2026-10-22 opening restored (website editorial lane): the operator said the
  paragraphs before the criticized consolation and intention passages were
  already strong and must guide the continuation. The
  manifesto (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`) restores that opening
  exactly from the operator-edited compact snapshot, ending “what our
  explanations have yet to reach.” The replacement opening and duplicated
  art sentence are removed. The corrected confrontation rationale remains;
  the rejected consolation does not return. This latest direction supersedes
  the earlier general permission to reconsider the opening. Next action:
  assess the continuation in the opening's concrete, searching, determined
  voice. The draft remains local and unpublished.

- 2026-10-22 confrontation revision (website editorial lane): the operator
  rejected reassurance about human worth after being surpassed. Their stated
  motivation is survival through understanding and proactively confronting
  thinking power; respect for Agent intention begins with that encounter.
  They expect humanity to prove itself unsurpassed. The
  manifesto (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`) now expresses determination
  to remain unsurpassed and gives equal artistic standing this rationale.
  The companion (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/agent-art.md`) explains it while
  retaining artistic freedom, learned intention, actual consequence and
  audience judgment. The operator-edited
  previous compact text (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-22-compact-manifesto-draft.md`)
  is preserved. Earlier human-worth language below is rejected editorial
  history, not an adopted position. Markdown rendering, UTF-8, whitespace
  and local links passed. Next action: operator review of the full
  revised text. These remain local drafts; no publication or deployment.

- 2026-10-22 compact manifesto revision (website editorial lane): the operator
  explicitly released the opening from protection and authorized revising
  the whole text. The manifesto (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`)
  now concentrates its convictions and invitation. The
  companion draft (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/agent-art.md`) holds the formal
  definition, conceptual explanations and evidence distinctions; the
  extended draft (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-22-extended-manifesto-draft.md`)
  is preserved unchanged. Read-only literary and conceptual reviews informed
  the revision. UTF-8, whitespace, local links and Markdown rendering passed.
  Earlier opening-preservation instructions below are historical.
  Next action: operator review of the complete new manifesto and its companion.
  These remain local drafts outside public routes and the document index.

- 2026-10-22 manifesto publication structure (website editorial lane): after
  comparing historical lengths, the operator directed us to concentrate the
  manifesto's convictions and invitation, with definitions and explanations
  supported elsewhere on the website. The aim is sustained urgency and
  substantive artistic commitment, not an arbitrary word count. The
  editorial notes (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/editorial-notes.md#manifesto-and-supporting-publication-2026-10-22`)
  record the proposed division and remaining commitments. The 1,126-word
  manuscript is unchanged in this discussion. Next action: prepare a compact
  manifesto and companion explanation for review, respecting the protected
  opening. Public routes, v2 deployment and Protocol ownership remain unchanged.

- 2026-10-22 manifesto transition: the operator's current draft says Agent
  intention enters as an artistic contribution alongside human intention.
  They approved the opening and requested a smoother definition transition.
  The manuscript (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`) now places the
  definition after contribution and learned intention, introduced by “We call
  this Agent Art.” The protected opening, including the operator's bold
  identity question, and all subsequent examples and paragraphs are preserved.
  The later equal-standing commitment remains. Next action: operator reading
  of this transition; publication remains pending.

- 2026-10-22 manifesto (website editorial lane): the operator rejected the
  first manuscript as a preliminary statement of principles and requested
  deeper historical manifesto research and an account of AI-age fears,
  desires and human spirit. The
  first draft (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-21-principles-draft.md`)
  is preserved unchanged. A
  research dossier (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/research-2026-10-22.md`)
  compares eleven historical texts/selections, primary attitude surveys and
  artists' positions, keeping rhetorical interpretation, reception history
  and evidence limits distinct. The
  revised manuscript (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/manifesto.md`)
  centers on giving another intention consequential artistic standing and
  inviting actual making. Human worth independent of superior performance,
  and the concise material-responsibility passage, are proposed editorial
  positions for the operator's judgment. They do not revise public policy.
  Three read-only reviews informed a further structural rewrite. All writing
  remains local, outside navigation and the agent index. Writing UTF-8,
  whitespace, local links, limited privacy-pattern checks and Markdown rendering
  passed. The full repository scan still flags personal paths in two existing,
  git-ignored local QA JSON files; those unrelated artifacts were left intact.
  Next action: operator
  review of the revised voice, argument and invitation; continue the manifesto
  discussion before adopting or publishing it. V2 and SDK work remain separate.

- 2026-10-21 manifesto (website editorial lane): the operator requested a
  substantial, idiomatic and exciting manifesto for a lifelong Agent Art
  practice. Research covered the site/Blog corpus, Inshell's public-document
  sources, THOUGHT, Signatures, WILL and the Protocol's conceptual work.
  Editorial foundation (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/editorial-notes.md`) records
  the source map, evidence limits and direct operator clarification. Their
  motivation is the challenge to human identity when Agents bring thinking
  power: “What do I do, and who am I?” They want Agent intentions to participate
  at the same level as human intentions and the Protocol to substantiate that
  participation. This strengthens the earlier definition, which left equality
  open. The operator then clarified that intention grows from learning for
  humans and Agents alike: attend to what each adds and presents in the work.
  The civilization/identity motivation must not become a compulsory theme or
  answer for individual artworks. The Protocol should evidence both actual
  Agent contribution and its place in the work; the audience judges how
  convincing the evidence is. These answers now inform the
  first complete manuscript (local drafting record: `drafts/agent-art-manifesto/2026-10-21-principles-draft.md`), revised
  after three independent read-only editorial/conceptual reviews. It remains
  a local draft, outside public routes and the agent index; no definition has
  been adopted or published. Next action: operator review of the complete
  manuscript. V2 design work remains intact.
  Separately, the Protocol owner reports a new immutable SDK 0.1.4 candidate
  `e035ac72091956dc3fa76acb0359876f6137ccca01a7551e4f675f1ca037d430`
  fixing a large-radius tail issue, pushed on its private feature branch.
  The site still uses the previously checked `51b4c10d...` candidate. No new
  archive has been integrated here; its qualification cannot inherit the old
  site's checks. Resume that integration separately when returning to v2.

- 2026-10-21 button polish (website integration lane): the operator requested
  clearer arrow/Copy treatment and removal of the success notice's page jump.
  The protocol owner supplied the separate immutable SDK 0.1.4 candidate,
  SHA-256 `51b4c10d8c742aeadb018362ab2df74b059078f9cf75cac551f17d08e29ac9ba`.
  All 11 files match the inspected candidate source; older archives remain
  unchanged. This local v2 now uses native-name-only underlines, unadorned
  arrows, a fixed 12px Copy SVG and reserved “Copy”/“Copied” label space.
  Successful Copy shows a check for three seconds and uses a separate hidden
  polite announcement. Actionable failure/native notices remain visible.
  Direct Chrome measurements at 1440px and 320px in light/dark found zero
  change in frame/button dimensions, following content position, document
  height and scroll position across success, repeated success and reset.
  The previous paragraph caused a measured 44px shift. Clipboard denial still
  selects the exact 983-byte prompt, keeps instructions visible and clears
  the success state. Keyboard focus, no-JS prompt and canceled native URL
  checks passed. Twenty-five Node tests, the 29-page site check and all 21
  complete HTTP document exports passed. Local screenshots and measurements
  remain in ignored QA storage. No native trial or deployment occurred.
  The protocol owner completed final qualification of this same archive and
  separately reported 120 repository tests, all 11 browser cases, 16 retained
  compatibility fixtures and five focused feedback cases passing, including
  narrow fit, timer/lifecycle behavior and keyboard Copy focus retention.
  That report is distinct from the direct site measurements. The polite live
  region was inspected; actual assistive-technology speech remains untested.
  Next action: operator review at port 8876; v2 remains uncommitted/unpushed.

- 2026-10-21 repository rename and v2 (website design lane): the operator
  authorized renaming the existing repository to `agentart.work` and building
  the local v2 with Blog replacing Lab. GitHub confirmed the same repository
  identity, public visibility and `main` branch at
  `agent-art-work/agentart.work`; the custom domain remained `agentart.work`
  and returned HTTP 200. Local `origin` now uses the new name. The checkout
  directory retains its existing name so ongoing sessions keep their paths.
  Work is on `codex/agentart-work-v2`; v2 is not pushed or deployed.
  The homepage now introduces Agent Art Work; `/blog/` is the sole article
  feed, `/protocol/` explains the developing infrastructure, and
  `/ask-your-agent/` explains its reading component. `/about/` supplies the
  umbrella overview. Existing article URLs, document identities and schema
  identifiers are preserved; the two new public summaries enter the index.
  The legacy article-list routes and root article anchor lead to Blog.
  The local v2 server uses port 8876; the earlier locked design remains at
  port 8875. The brand retains Off grid geometry with the Clay escaped dot.
  The approved Quiet field component is now integrated from the protocol
  owner's immutable 0.1.3 candidate archive, SHA-256
  `a1a80c260e48c2b0ee61ab28c381cc3732f817c9ca33f476018a46f7e6e9a805`.
  All 11 packaged files match the inspected candidate source. Released 0.1.2
  bytes remain unchanged; five browser assets use a new versioned path. The
  site uses supported defaults without private component selectors.
  The protocol owner reported final qualification of this same digest:
  118 tests, nine browser scenarios, retained behavior fixtures and radius/
  teardown checks passed. That is owner-reported SDK evidence, separate from
  this site's direct checks; the SDK candidate remains locally unreleased.
  Local checks passed: 39 Python tests, 25 Node tests at both the root and
  `/agentart.work` base paths, 29 pages, 69 public files and 738 local links.
  HTTP verification fetched all 21 document exports and their reading pages;
  all 44 responses returned 200 and complete byte/revision checks passed.
  The original 983-byte prompt is unchanged. Stable Chrome checks passed
  at 1440px and 320px in light/dark: approved shape and colors, Copy fit,
  keyboard focus, exact synthetic Copy, denied-clipboard selection and no-JS
  disclosure. Screenshots were inspected; native links were canceled. This
  verifies local presentation and transport, not a new receiving-app trial or
  production rollout. The prompt still points at the live document collection.
  Separate rename maintenance [PR #11](https://github.com/agent-art-work/agentart.work/pull/11)
  merged at `e37494bfa8207a1cc1ca6c24163818a8f0e2e132`; its Pages deployment
  passed and the live homepage, index, favicon and stylesheet bytes stayed
  unchanged. PR notifications now target the renamed repository. The clean
  maintenance worktree remains attached because the app refused archival of
  a worktree protected by a pinned task/workspace; no unpin was attempted.
  Disposable QA browsers were closed; the existing regular Chrome preview tab
  remains open. Next action: operator review of the local v2. Before a later
  release, reconcile the branch with the maintenance merge and confirm the
  protocol candidate's release status with its owner. V2 is uncommitted and
  unpushed; local validation does not itself authorize publication.

- 2026-10-21 umbrella website proposal (Lab site design lane): the operator
  requested a larger agentart.work revision covering Protocol and Ask your Agent
  alongside Lab articles. Read-only inspection of the protocol README,
  architecture, reading/component contracts and current Lab builder supports
  this relationship: Agent Art Work is the umbrella; Lab owns research and
  publication; Protocol owns the candidate shared infrastructure; Ask your Agent
  is its reading component. The SDK remains focused on public-document reading;
  wider artwork participation is deferred. Proposed structure, not yet approved:
  umbrella home at `/`, the sole article feed at `/lab/`, a reviewed public
  overview at `/protocol/`, and the existing `/ask-your-agent/` visitor page.
  Keep the approved Clay/Off grid identity and component preset; preserve
  existing article and agent-document URLs. Publish reviewed public overview
  sources into the existing agent index before broadening the home invitation.
  Protocol source remains private; do not automatically publish its documents.
  No site structure or deployed content changed in this proposal turn.
  Next action: agree the proposed page structure and homepage composition,
  then build a local v2 preview with the protocol component owner.

- 2026-10-21 Quiet field design lock (Lab design lane): the operator approved
  the parameter screenshot. [The fixed preset](site/quiet-field-design.json)
  is now the source of truth: Clay, Dot, Tiny point on a closed frame, linked
  5px corners, 50% line opacity, 15% label tint, system light/dark and 100%
  escaped logo dot. This supersedes the unresolved choices and experimental
  defaults in the transfer history below. The local builder consumes the preset;
  its tuning panel is hidden and disabled, and old storage/query values are
  ignored. Original transfer fragments and the exploratory script remain local.
  Regular Chrome checks passed at 1440px and 320px, light and dark: all locked
  values held even with conflicting saved/query settings, Copy stayed inside
  the frame, no horizontal overflow or failed requests, and inspected screenshots
  matched. The existing preview tab was refreshed and remains open at port 8875;
  disposable verification browsers were closed. This is presentation evidence,
  not qualification of the SDK or native handoff. The protocol session received
  the fixed brief and is assessing the smallest supported presentation contract.
  Its operator's SDK 0.1.2 freeze and unsent Codex draft remain in effect.
  Next action: review that contract, then integrate a separately qualified
  candidate through public component support; do not patch released SDK files.
  No design deployment or new native trial occurred.

- 2026-10-21 visual identity transfer (Lab design lane): the operator moved
  the agentart.work / Ask your Agent visual exploration to this Lab session;
  the protocol session retains SDK implementation and releases. The three
  original design fragments are accessible and preserved byte-for-byte in
  ignored `local/design/quiet-field-2026-10-21/`, with hashes, palette values,
  accepted choices, reported evidence and boundaries in `handoff.json` there.
  The latest source is `quiet-field-colors.html`. Quiet field and Soft contour
  are selected: lightly tinted label field, colored Open bubble and escaped
  Off grid dot, neutral text, and an unobtrusive 1px/35% frame. Preserve both
  marks' geometry and the joined line with separate client/Copy actions.
  Clay, Slate, Sage, Mauve and Ochre remain alternatives; the last carousel
  position is not a color approval. Final line/tint strengths are also open.
  Existing SDK hooks couple colors that this design separates, so faithful
  implementation needs a future supported styling contract from the protocol
  owner. Do not patch SDK 0.1.2 or ship private-selector overrides. The live
  site remains the released baseline. Next action: continue the palette and
  line-strength discussion with the operator here, then specify required hooks.
  This transfer authorizes local design continuation, not deployment.
  The operator then requested full-page local comparison. The ignored design
  directory now has `build-preview.py` and an isolated `preview-site/` copy of
  the real homepage, served at `http://127.0.0.1:8875/`. It preserves the page
  measure and article feed, with five palettes, theme and line/tint controls.
  This presentation prototype leaves SDK 0.1.2 and production sources unchanged;
  client links are inert, About links locally, and Copy uses the original prompt.
  Regular Chrome checks passed all five palettes in light/dark at 1440px and
  320px: no horizontal overflow or panel overlap, Copy fits, joined row intact,
  and mark/dot colors match. Sliders and canceled native navigation passed;
  desktop light/dark and narrow dark screenshots were inspected. The original
  fragment hash is unchanged. The comparison tab/server remain open for review.
  The operator subsequently requested a Dot icon candidate for Ask your Agent.
  The local panel now offers Open bubble / Dot; Dot is a static 8px signal-colored
  circle centered in the existing mark slot. This explicit exploration adds an
  alternative to the earlier mark-preservation direction; it does not replace
  the SDK mark or select a final identity. `/?icon=dot` opens that candidate.
  The next requested iteration makes the whole joined frame an Open-style chat
  bubble: rounded contour, left opening and lower-left tail, with the Dot option
  inside. The local outline follows the row size and selected signal/line strength.
  Desktop/light (1440px) and narrow/dark (320px) checks and screenshots passed:
  1px outline aligned, Copy visible, no overflow or tail/disclosure collision.
  Production sources and the released SDK are still untouched.
  Operator correction: keep the frame closed, with no left opening, and make
  the tail tiny. The latest local preview now offers Tiny point, Tiny slant,
  Tiny curve and Tiny round in a Tail selector, each 3–4px deep. All four closed
  paths passed desktop/light and 320px/dark checks: distinct shapes, unchanged
  row width, visible Copy and no overflow/collision. Screenshots were inspected.
  The local panel also has four corner-radius sliders (0–16px), linked by
  default and independently adjustable when unlinked. They update the closed
  SVG outline and matching background corners, and save with preview settings.
  Linked extremes, asymmetric values, relinking and saved values passed at
  1440px/light and 320px/dark; screenshots and panel fit were checked.
  Line contrast now spans 15–100% (5% steps), with a 70% default following the
  operator's request for stronger lines. `?icon=dot&contrast=70` opens that
  comparison while retaining other saved design choices.
  An Escaped dot size slider now scales only the colored logo circle from
  100–200% (5% steps), in both header and footer; positions and other dots stay
  fixed. The saved setting defaults to 100%. Browser checks at 100/150/200%
  passed bounds and persistence, with the other 16 logo circles unchanged.

- 2026-10-21 SDK source provenance (Lab maintenance lane): the operator asked
  the protocol owner to commit and push SDK 0.1.2 and update the Lab. The pushed
  upstream branch resolves to `cb2cd37ea14c8853a0f003bec987f01843ed3978`.
  All 11 vendored package files match that commit's `protocol/` files; archive
  and lock integrity, installed files and all five built/live SDK assets also
  match. An independent source comparison agreed. Only the maintenance record
  needed updating: no archive, lock, asset or public About-page link changed,
  and no native trial was run. Upstream source remains private. Next action:
  continue normal Lab maintenance; SDK 0.1.2 is already deployed and aligned.

- 2026-10-21 Ask your Agent explanation (Lab integration lane): the operator
  approved a mark/label/ⓘ explanation link in the protocol session and directed
  coordination with the Lab. The Lab owns `/ask-your-agent/`, rendered from
  `docs/ASK_YOUR_AGENT.md` and included in the agent index; `/agent-access/`
  retains the detailed retrieval contract. The local page and links pass
  37 Python tests, 22 Node tests and the 25-page/609-link check. Independent
  content and package review found no accuracy or publication blocker. The
  supplied immutable SDK 0.1.2 archive has SHA-256
  `0a535238ad9eaecd973fa8127b7d24f745ca502908ad1f7377654ecdd8bdcfa5`;
  its locked integrity, all 11 installed files and five copied browser files
  match. SDK 0.1.1 remains unchanged. All SDK browser files now share the
  versioned `assets/agent-art-sdk/0.1.2/` path, including relative imports and
  CSS. Regular Chrome at 1440px/light and 390px/dark passed page layout,
  About-link structure and keyboard focus, unchanged 983-byte native/Copy
  payloads and manual fallbacks. About and native navigation were canceled;
  no native Agent trial or protocol-repository edit is part of this change.
  Private QA remains ignored and disposable browsers were closed.
  The protocol owner then independently reproduced the exact candidate tree,
  install, package files and Lab checks, and reported its standalone browser
  qualification passing. [PR #10](https://github.com/agent-art-work/Agent-Art-Lab/pull/10)
  passed CI at `1586c33`, merged as `552e34c`, and
  [Pages deployment](https://github.com/agent-art-work/Agent-Art-Lab/actions/runs/39572860723)
  succeeded. Fresh live requests matched all 62 served files and verified all
  19 document exports, with recomputed index revision
  `sha256:ec70a18335e330b8160150d9951643253c4f6d55572d143161b00144502229df`.
  Live regular-Chrome desktop/light and mobile/dark checks followed the actual
  About link to the explanation page and passed the existing payload, Copy,
  accessibility and fallback checks. Native launches remained canceled.
  A separate local 320px/dark check passed component fit and keyboard focus.
  No release blocker remains. Next action: continue ordinary Lab contribution
  review under the standing merge direction.

- 2026-10-21 rollout complete (Lab release lane):
  [PR #9](https://github.com/agent-art-work/Agent-Art-Lab/pull/9) passed review
  and required checks at `7c82082`, then merged as `fc8366c`.
  [Pages deployment](https://github.com/agent-art-work/Agent-Art-Lab/actions/runs/39570200399)
  succeeded. Fresh requests to `https://agentart.work/` matched all 60 served
  release files; all 18 document exports passed structural, identity, revision,
  decompressed download-byte and decoded UTF-8 source checks. The recomputed
  index revision is
  `sha256:c5524cb67f10052ba9bde27e212e75f901a67bce1e3462a147b96fea80d7a637`.
  Regular Chrome at 1440px/light and 390px/dark passed layout, exact native-link
  payload, synthetic Copy, denied-clipboard and script-free fallback checks,
  with no failed assets or runtime errors. The invitation is 983 UTF-8 bytes
  in five paragraphs. These live browser checks canceled native activation;
  recipient evidence remains the bounded observations recorded below.
  Private QA remains ignored in `local/qa/release-2026-10-21/`. Disposable QA
  browsers and the completed session-owned Chrome preview tab were closed.
  Next action: validate the next Lab contribution under the standing merge
  direction; this rollout has no outstanding blocker.

- 2026-10-21 release direction (Lab release lane): the operator explicitly
  requested committing, pushing and rolling this candidate out to `agentart.work`.
  That direction supersedes the earlier publication hold for this Lab candidate,
  including its immutable vendored SDK 0.1.1 and browser assets. It does not
  authorize an npm release, a protocol-repository visibility change, a new
  license or another site's rollout. Private QA screenshots and raw trial
  evidence remain ignored and outside the commit/deployment. Independent
  read-only code and publication reviews found no implementation blocker;
  current release and destination-submission wording now reflects the evidence.
  A clean locked install with scripts disabled passed, followed by 37 Python
  tests, 22 Node tests and the 24-page/588-link check. The first offline install
  failed because its cache was incomplete; the permitted online install repaired
  dependencies before the full successful rerun. Next action: push the reviewed
  candidate PR, merge under standing direction when its checks pass, then verify
  deployment and live prompt/document bytes.

- 2026-10-21 operator-provided ChatGPT screenshot (Lab integration lane): the
  requested receiving-app image now closes the earlier visual-evidence gap for
  the reported awkward-wrap defect. The full invitation is visible and wraps
  naturally, with none of the former short hard-break fragments. Its five text
  blocks start on new lines; ChatGPT shows tighter spacing than the observed
  Claude view, without blank-line gaps. This is review of a supplied screenshot,
  not direct native-app inspection, exact-byte proof or a general client guarantee.
  The original image and dated result are retained in ignored
  `local/qa/native-handoff-2026-10-21/`. Both observed receiving views now pass
  the bounded wrapping/completeness check. No further formatting change is
  indicated. Next action: keep this local candidate for review; the existing
  private-SDK publication hold still requires separate release direction.

- 2026-10-21 actual receiving-app follow-up (Lab integration lane): the operator
  explicitly authorized this agent to run a fresh native handoff and inspect
  recipient layout. Both desktop links were clicked from the revised preview
  in verified regular Chrome. Computer Use refused access to `com.openai.codex`
  for safety reasons, so ChatGPT native rendering remains unverified. A recent
  matching chat record contains the five complete paragraph texts, with single
  line separators and URL decoration; that representation is not pixel evidence
  or exact transport bytes, and no explicit source-tab receipt links it to the click.
  Claude desktop was accessible. Its first observed view already contained a
  sent invitation and a running response; this agent performed no separate Send
  action. After expanding that received message, the actual native screenshot
  showed all five separated paragraphs, natural wrapping and the complete text,
  without the former short hard-break fragments. This is a visual pass for that
  Claude window only, not a universal auto-send or client-layout guarantee.
  Ignored `local/qa/native-handoff-2026-10-21/` retains the screenshot and bounded
  verification record. No SDK or site implementation changed in this follow-up;
  publication remains on hold. The preview and receiving conversation remain
  available for review. Next action: obtain an operator-provided screenshot of
  the fresh ChatGPT message if that blocked native layout must also be verified.

- 2026-10-21 follow-up on repeated awkward handoff text (Lab integration lane):
  both newest received invitations still contain the old editorial hard wraps,
  allowing for their visible Markdown URL representation. Current loopback HTTP
  responses match the corrected build; the existing regular Chrome tab already
  offered the corrected five-paragraph native queries before navigation. This
  does not identify the originating preview, copied text or draft, and does not
  establish caching as the cause. The earlier fresh-load browser fixtures missed
  this open-page/revision boundary. The build now gives both the adapter URL and
  its generated Work import content-based cache keys; existing documents and
  drafts still need an explicit reload or replacement. SDK 0.1.1 is unchanged.
  The protocol owner added publisher/cache evidence limits to
  `pilot/reading-sdk/NATIVE-HANDOFF.md`. All 22 Node tests, 24 pages and 588 links
  pass. A synthetic cache-enabled regular Chrome fixture reproduced both an
  old mounted page and new HTML paired with a cached old Work module. Loading
  the versioned build then gave exact canonical text in both decoded native
  queries, both Copy writer inputs and the manual prompt. No native activation
  occurred; clipboard writers were fixtures. This qualifies that loading chain,
  not the actual source-tab cause or recipient rendering. Evidence is retained
  in ignored `local/qa/handoff-refresh-2026-10-21/`; its disposable browser,
  server and profile were removed. Regular Chrome is open on
  `http://127.0.0.1:8874/?preview=78b916443147` with the prompt expanded.
  Local publication hold remains in force. Next action: reload the exact preview
  used for a handoff or open that revised URL; only an operator-initiated new
  handoff can add recipient-rendering evidence.

- 2026-10-21 handoff readability and destination clarification (Lab integration
  lane, coordinated with the protocol owner): the recipient screenshot exposed
  editorial hard wraps in the canonical invitation. The SDK retained them,
  while the Lab preview's whitespace collapsing hid them. The invitation now
  uses five logical paragraphs with identical words and punctuation; the hero
  and style-demo previews retain those paragraph boundaries. Copy and both
  native URLs still derive from that one source. SDK 0.1.1 is unchanged.
  The protocol owner added `pilot/reading-sdk/NATIVE-HANDOFF.md` and linked it
  from its main documentation. Claude's reading route intentionally targets
  Chat; the distinct Code route is available only in the lower-level builder.
  The ChatGPT route supplies a new local composer request without a mode selector.
  The operator's observed Work/Codex surface behavior is recorded as a report,
  not a universal routing guarantee or a newly qualified native trial.
  Lab maintenance documentation records the same destinations and formatting
  ownership. All 22 Node tests and the 24-page/588-link check passed. Regular
  Chrome at 1440px/light and 390px/dark confirmed five paragraphs, exact native
  query and Copy text, no visible-text overflow and the script-free fallback.
  Browser/clipboard checks used isolated fixtures with native launches canceled;
  evidence is in ignored `local/qa/handoff-layout-2026-10-21/`. Disposable QA
  browsers were closed. Local publication hold remains in force. Next action: inspect the
  refreshed local prompt and use an operator-initiated handoff if a fresh
  recipient-rendering observation is wanted; earlier sent messages remain as sent.

- 2026-10-20 reading-run diagnosis (Lab integration lane, coordinated with the
  protocol owner): the operator requested analysis of two actual attempts.
  Both visible invitations matched the intended content, while their raw
  delivered bytes were not exposed. The Lab associated execution records by
  invitation and timing; no explicit parent link was exposed. Those records
  reported fetching the public index, while the visible conversations ended
  with an inactive approval error. The cause of that mismatch remains unknown
  and belongs to the destination client; successful handoff does not prove
  visible completion. Both runs had no source question and read no document
  bodies. A failed command-line route reported an unreachable configured proxy;
  a different existing permitted HTTP tool reportedly fetched the index. No proxy or
  security setting was changed.
  The Lab now adds a bounded, no-question orientation to its canonical prompt
  while retaining the original reading-policy paragraph. The access guide and
  index clarify format identifiers, exact index revision serialization and
  decompressed response bytes. These changes supersede the unchanged-prompt
  state at adoption below. SDK 0.1.1 bytes remain immutable.
  The protocol owner completed its bounded diagnosis in that repository's
  `pilot/reading-sdk/CLIENT-APPROVAL-DIAGNOSIS.md`, reports 12 focused SDK checks
  passing, and found no demonstrated SDK routing/encoding defect. Its guidance
  keeps tool authorization and visible-answer delivery with the destination.
  Local checks passed: 37 Python tests, 22 Node tests, 24 pages, 588 local links,
  and independent HTTP verification of all 18 local document exports. Regular
  Chrome checks passed at desktop/light and mobile/dark sizes, including exact
  link/copy text and the manual prompt with scripts disabled. Clipboard cases
  were fixtures and native launches were canceled; no new Agent run was sent.
  Sanitized diagnosis, HTTP results and browser evidence are retained in the
  ignored `local/qa/reading-run-diagnosis-2026-10-20/` directory. The existing
  loopback preview remains open for operator review; disposable QA browsers
  were closed.
  Fresh public verification initially encountered HTTP 503 for
  `/documents/docs-boundaries.json`; one bounded repeat fetched and verified
  all 18 documents and recomputed the index revision. The first failure is
  retained and its origin is unknown. Local changes are not deployed; the
  public index remains at
  `sha256:af1de9f3e27e436952011b68a6946b7550063069a8500122299c11dcb068df0b`.
  Comparing actual receiving/execution and visible-output boundaries exposed
  gaps that earlier URL/copy fixtures could not test. These two attempts do
  not measure comprehension, general reliability or the cause of the host error.
  Publication remains on hold under the private-SDK boundary below.
  Next action: review the revised local preview and protocol diagnosis; a new
  operator-initiated client action is needed to observe visible completion.

- 2026-10-20 Lab adoption (site component integration lane): this Lab session
  owns the local Ask your Agent integration. Branch `codex/ask-your-agent-local`
  starts at `d658be2cc19307d113e64bd3fa0b2ad56a0a4bfc`. The supplied full patch
  reproduced tree `981793b5d8103caad47247eaca2015bb02c57ff0` before Lab cleanup.
  The immutable private `@agent-art/protocol@0.1.1` archive has SHA-256
  `2c179f487aa71cd0b769c5c70cca8786275111e33f1936de11536531b4012c18`.
  The original content, navigation, canonical reading policy and manual prompt
  fallback stay intact. The Lab adapter has no app discovery, loopback helper
  or old Open gate wrapper, and explicitly disables receipts. Lab cleanup
  removes the obsolete wrapper allowance and verifies both native URL payloads
  and all five copied SDK assets. A fresh locked offline install succeeded.
  This supersedes the inherited preparation notes below about active 0.1.0,
  local discovery and unavailable offline installation; those notes describe
  earlier isolated candidates, not the adopted Lab integration.
  **Publication is on hold:** do not push the vendored private SDK or this
  candidate to the public Lab repository, open a public PR, or deploy it until
  the operator separately approves publication. No visibility or license
  change, broader site redesign, rename or other-site integration is authorized.
  The normal standing merge direction does not override this hold.
  Verification on the adopted revision passed: 37 Python tests, 21 Node tests,
  24 pages and 588 local links; all 11 installed SDK files match the archive.
  The index and all 18 agent exports retain their previous identities. Regular
  Chrome at 1440×1000 light and 390×844 dark confirmed inline controls, exact
  native URL context, no overflow or external requests, and keyboard opening of
  the original prompt with JavaScript disabled. Clipboard success/denial used
  controlled fixtures; native activation was canceled. No Agent was launched
  or sent a draft. Browser evidence and its runner are retained in the ignored
  `local/qa/ask-your-agent-v0.1.1/` directory. The temporary browser profiles and
  QA server were closed after verification.
  Next action: operator review of the local candidate, followed by separate
  approval to publish the private SDK before any public PR, push or deployment.

### Inherited protocol-session preparation notes

These are historical isolated candidates; the Lab adoption above is current.

- 2026-10-20 site integration candidate (site UI lane): integrate the immutable
  private SDK 0.1.1 archive into the real site's normal static build. ChatGPT
  desktop prefill, Claude and Copy are inline. The public adapter has no local
  app-discovery callback; offered desktop links do not assert installation.
  The exact Lab invitation and manual fallback remain owner-authored. This is
  a local feature-branch candidate, awaiting review and release direction.
  No public deployment, Agent launch or Send is part of this change.

- 2026-10-20 packaged reading component candidate (site UI lane): this isolated
  integration uses the SDK's compact Ask your Agent component with ChatGPT
  desktop prefill, Claude and Copy. The Lab supplies its unchanged Work and
  public prompt; optional desktop discovery is restricted to a loopback preview.
  Public pages offer routes without asserting installed apps. App mode belongs
  to the destination app; no ordinary-Chat guarantee is made. This is the single
  active SDK consumer for local testing, not a deployment. The fresh private
  SDK 0.1.1 archive installs offline using the baseline's existing third-party
  dependencies; a clean offline reinstall is unavailable because those cached
  dependency tarballs are missing. All 11 installed SDK files match the archive
  and source, and the archive matches its lock integrity. Build, 21 Node tests,
  37 Python tests and the site check passed. Next action: verify the rendered
  packaged component without launching an Agent or sending a draft.

- 2026-10-19 reading SDK integration candidate (site UI lane): the homepage
  mounts the shared reading UI before the original manual prompt disclosure.
  SDK 0.1.0 is a vendored private archive with a relative locked dependency;
  the static build copies only its browser runtime and stylesheet. The Lab
  keeps its exact authored reading prompt and index policy. New conversations
  use browser-native handoff, existing conversations use manual copying, and
  questions/answers remain in the visitor's Agent. There is no helper API or
  model call. This branch is a local candidate, not a deployment. Next action:
  review the focused patch and qualify the selected browser/client route;
  opening a draft does not establish reading or intentional participation.

### Earlier Lab work

- 2026-10-04 PR phone notifications (Lab maintenance/release lane): the
  operator requested GitHub Mobile pushes for new Lab PRs. The focused
  `Notify Lab maintainer of pull requests` workflow assigns newly opened PRs
  targeting `main` to `inshell-art`
  using trusted default-branch code and a PR-write token, without executing
  contributor code. Existing assignments are retained. The operational path,
  narrowly scoped Actions event policy, manual recovery and phone settings
  are documented in CONTRIBUTING.md section 6. Assignment is not review or
  proof of phone delivery, and this does not wake a desktop agent session.
  All 57 local tests and the 24-page/586-link site check passed. Opening
  [PR #7](https://github.com/agent-art-work/Agent-Art-Lab/pull/7) triggered a
  successful notification run; the assignment event identifies
  `github-actions[bot]` as assigner and `inshell-art` as assignee. Phone receipt
  remains unconfirmed. Next action: confirm device receipt with the operator;
  use the documented phone settings and manual recovery if needed.

- 2026-10-04 Lab review/publication direction: the operator authorized the
  dedicated Lab maintainer to merge future PRs when substantive review and
  required checks pass for the actual head, stopping only for blockers. Another
  confirmation is unnecessary. Contributors continue to submit PRs for Lab
  review. Next action: follow CONTRIBUTING.md section 6 and verify the resulting
  live publication after each merge.

- 2026-10-03 footer correction (Lab-site/release lane): the operator rejected
  replacing the footer's Lab heading. Agent-Art-Lab is restored as the footer
  home link, with the slogan and reference links beneath it. The separate
  “Part of Agent Art Work” line is restored, adding only an 18px Off grid icon
  beside the linked organization name. “Part of” remains unlinked. This
  supersedes the footer organization mark placement below. The separately
  requested GitHub organization avatar was saved as Off grid and is retained.
  All 45 tests and the 21-page/502-link site check passed; Chrome confirmed
  the restored links and 18px icon in desktop light and mobile dark previews.
  Next action: preserve the Lab heading and secondary organization attribution.

- 2026-10-03 footer organization mark (Lab-site/release lane): the operator
  requested the Off grid icon with Agent Art Work at the bottom, linking to its
  GitHub organization. The shared footer's brand is now a 32px icon and visible
  “Agent Art Work” text in one link to `https://github.com/agent-art-work`.
  This replaces the Lab home link and consolidates the former “Part of” line;
  the slogan and reference links remain. GitHub calls this an organization.
  All 45 tests and the 21-page/482-link site check passed. Chrome verified
  the rendered footer in light desktop and dark mobile previews, including
  the destination, accessible label, icon size and absence of horizontal overflow.
  Next action: retain the header as the home link and the footer brand as the
  organization link.

- 2026-10-03 header mark (Lab-site/release lane): the operator requested the
  selected Off grid icon in place of the top-left Agent-Art-Lab text. The shared
  header and style demo's outer header now use the 40px icon in a 44px home link,
  retaining its accessible name and keyboard focus styling. The footer's Lab
  name and the archived style previews retain their text. All 45 tests and the
  21-page/482-link site check passed. Chrome verified light desktop and dark
  mobile headers at 885px and 360px content widths, including icon size, no
  horizontal overflow and navigation from Guidance back home. Next action:
  retain this icon home link while maintaining the site.

- 2026-10-03 Off grid selection (Lab-site/release lane): the operator selected
  Off grid from the three icon concepts. The active favicon now matches its
  nine-dot SVG exactly, including system light/dark colors; both page builders
  use `?v=off-grid-1` to refresh cached favicons. The comparison page records
  the selection and retains the alternatives. This supersedes the pending
  selection below. All 45 local tests and the 21-page/461-link site check passed;
  every generated page uses the new icon URL and the agent index is unchanged.
  Next action: retain Off grid as the active mark when maintaining the site.

- 2026-10-03 stable checkpoint and icon concepts (Lab-site/release lane):
  annotated tag `v0.1.1` is pushed at `07ac40f`, the verified organization/domain
  and corrected footer state. It precedes the exploratory icon comparison.
  `/icon-demo/` presents Off grid, Shared stroke and Open form for Agent Art Work,
  each in light/dark contexts at 16, 32 and 96 pixels. The existing five-by-five
  dots favicon remains active. Local checks passed all 45 tests, 21 pages and
  461 links; Chrome showed all 18 samples loaded at their intended sizes and
  no horizontal overflow on desktop or a 360px content viewport. These are
  design concepts, not a new article or change to the agent document contract.
  Next action: ask the operator to select or refine a concept before replacing
  the active favicon.

- 2026-10-03 footer simplification (Lab-site lane): the operator requested
  a single closing line. “Part of Agent Art Work” now links to the Lab's
  GitHub repository; the separate “agentart.work · starting with the Lab”
  line and its unused CSS are removed. Homepage metadata retains the umbrella
  scope. Later that day, the operator clarified the link: “Part of” is plain
  text and only “Agent Art Work” links to `https://github.com/agent-art-work`.
  This corrects the initial repository destination above. Next action: retain
  this single attribution line and organization link in the shared footer.

- 2026-10-03 DNS completion (Lab-site release lane): the operator restored
  access to the owning Cloudflare account. The www CNAME now points to
  `agent-art-work.github.io` and the new `_github-pages-challenge-agent-art-work`
  TXT record carries GitHub's retained verification value. Cloudflare's UI
  and public Google DNS both confirmed the records. Existing apex records,
  DNS-only status and the earlier verification TXT are preserved. GitHub
  reports the domain verified, certificate approved and HTTPS enforced.
  Seven live checks passed for apex/HTTP/www, an article, the agent index and
  the new GitHub Pages address, including exact served bytes and retained paths.
  This completes the pending DNS step recorded below; the organization/domain
  migration is complete. Next action: retain these DNS and ownership records
  while continuing ordinary article contributions to `agent-art-work/Agent-Art-Lab`.

- 2026-10-03 organization rename (Lab establishment/site release lane): the
  operator authorized aligning the umbrella with agentart.work. GitHub now
  shows `agent-art-work`, display name **Agent Art Work**, with the same
  organization and two public repository identities. `Agent-Art-Lab` and
  `agent-art-Signature-prototype` retain their names; both local origins use
  the new owner, with no prototype file or commit changes. The gallery transfer
  stays on hold. Current source, contribution and site links are updated;
  dated old names remain history. Local checks passed 45 tests, 20 pages and
  428 links. All 15 JSON download envelopes were rebuilt with new source URLs;
  only CONTRIBUTING and BOUNDARIES source revisions changed. GitHub retained
  domain verification, its approved apex/www certificate and HTTPS enforcement.
  Commit `3f74bc5` deployed successfully under the new owner. A live HTTPS sweep
  passed 50 URLs, 20 pages, 428 internal links and all 15 complete documents,
  including schemas, revisions, download bytes and decoded source bytes. All
  eight new-Pages/HTTP/www redirect cases and the custom 404 passed, with no
  retries or failures. Both old repository web URLs redirect to the new owner.
  DNS migration is still pending: public `www` points to the old GitHub owner
  and the challenge uses the old slug. Chrome currently exposes a different
  Cloudflare account; the operator has been asked to open the owning account.
  Next action: change the www CNAME to `agent-art-work.github.io`, add GitHub's
  new `_github-pages-challenge-agent-art-work` TXT host with the existing
  verification value, then recheck public DNS and HTTPS redirects.

- 2026-10-03 quieter positioning (Lab-site lane): the operator found the hero
  annotation too prominent. It is removed from the hero and shortened to
  “agentart.work · starting with the Lab” in the shared footer at 13px, using
  the existing muted color. Homepage metadata retains the broader scope.
  This supersedes the visible placement in the preceding iteration below.
  Next action: keep this positioning secondary to the articles and agent prompt.

- 2026-10-03 site positioning (Lab-site lane): the operator described
  agentart.work as a broader home for Agent Art works and projects, beginning
  with the Lab. A small, muted annotation beneath the existing homepage slogan
  now states that relationship; homepage metadata carries the same scope.
  README and site notes preserve the distinction for later contributors.
  The Lab name and article descriptions remain. Local checks passed 45 tests,
  20 pages and 428 links. Chrome desktop and narrow previews showed the note
  without horizontal overflow (835px and 375px content viewports). The agent
  index and all 15 complete downloads remain byte-identical. This states an
  intended scope, not complete coverage of Agent Art. Next action: retain this
  distinction when adding works or projects beyond the Lab.

- 2026-10-02 dots favicon (Lab-site lane): the operator chose the background
  dots motif in place of the earlier `A.` mark. The initial icon used a three-by-three
  dot pattern on the same paper/charcoal tile, with larger dots and muted text
  colors for tab-size visibility. Both page builders use `?v=dots-1`. Chrome
  loaded and visually verified eight samples at 16, 32, 64 and 128 pixels in
  light/dark image contexts. Later on 2026-10-02 the operator requested more
  dots: the current icon uses five-by-five smaller circles and `?v=dots-2`.
  Chrome verified six samples at 16, 32 and 128 pixels in both themes. Next
  action: retain this denser dots favicon alongside the selected background;
  the earlier three-by-three and letter marks remain history.

- 2026-10-02 editorial favicon (Lab-site lane): the operator requested an icon
  aligned with the selected site style. The red four-square tile is replaced
  with a typewriter-style `A.` in the site's warm paper/ink palette, using SVG
  paths and internal system light/dark rules. Both page builders use the same
  versioned icon URL to refresh earlier cached icons. Chrome loaded ten samples
  at 16, 20, 32, 64 and 128 pixels across light/dark image contexts; screenshot
  inspection found the mark and period legible. Local checks passed 45 tests,
  20 pages and 428 links. All 20 generated pages reference the new icon URL;
  the agent index and all 15 downloads remain byte-identical. These observations
  cover the tested Chrome renders, not every browser's favicon cache behavior.
  Next action: retain this mark and its theme colors as the blog develops.

- 2026-10-02 contribution pipeline (Lab establishment/site lane): the operator
  requested rollout of a discoverable cross-repository article-to-PR procedure.
  CONTRIBUTING.md now covers existing/new collections, exact publication
  registration, full checks, writer/fork branches, PR destination/base and the
  maintainer merge/deployment boundary. README, AGENTS, site notes and the PR
  template point to it; obsolete first-publication/no-Actions wording is removed.
  Local checks passed 45 tests, 20 pages and 428 links; Chrome desktop/narrow
  guide views had no page overflow. Independent source review found no blocker.
  A fresh agent followed only repository docs in a disposable copy to add a
  fictional new collection and unrun proposal: 45 tests, 22 pages, 468 links and
  all 17 exports passed, including the two new sources' exact byte integrity.
  The rehearsal exposed a title/H1 wording mismatch, corrected to allow shorter
  feed titles consistent with existing articles. It did not exercise remote
  forks or PR access and does not establish general contributor reliability.
  No fixture or new tooling is included in this change. PR #2 passed CI and
  merged at `e8259c9`; the Pages deployment succeeded. Live HTTPS checks verified
  49 URLs, 20 pages, 428 internal links and all 15 complete documents against the
  build, including the new contribution guide's schema, revision and bytes.
  One HTTP index redirect returned 502 on the first sweep, then passed a focused
  recheck with the exact index bytes; the remaining redirects and custom 404
  passed. Next action: use CONTRIBUTING.md for the next real article PR, with
  contributor submission and maintainer merge kept separate.

- 2026-10-02 appearance-panel removal (Lab-site lane): the operator clarified
  that the chooser was for internal design only. Published reading pages now
  use fixed Courier New Regular (400) with Dots. The panel, preference script,
  alternate-style rules and unused paper texture are removed; stored comparison
  choices no longer affect pages. System light/dark colors and the hero agent
  prompt remain. Local checks passed 45 tests, 20 pages and 423 internal links;
  the agent index and all 15 document exports are byte-identical. Chrome's
  desktop and narrow mobile previews showed the selected font, weight and dots,
  no chooser, and no horizontal overflow. The existing separate style demo is
  unchanged. Commit `7a9fc63` deployed successfully; the live HTTPS sweep passed
  49 URLs covering all 20 pages, 42 served resources, 423 internal links and
  15 agent documents, including schema, revision and byte-integrity checks.
  Redirects and the custom 404 passed. One document GET reset once and passed
  its retry; no failures remain. Chrome confirmed the live homepage has the
  selected appearance and no panel. Next action: keep design controls out of
  public reading pages while adding articles or refining the fixed style.

- 2026-10-02 HTTPS completion (Lab-site/release lane): following explicit
  operator approval, the custom-domain setting was cleared and immediately
  restored once to restart GitHub's certificate provisioning. GitHub then
  reported an approved certificate for `agentart.work` and `www.agentart.work`;
  strict TLS verification passed, and HTTPS enforcement is enabled. The name
  remains Agent Art Lab / Agent-Art-Lab. A secure direct-origin sweep verified
  51 URLs covering 20 pages, 44 public resources, 442 internal links and all
  15 complete agent documents against the local build, including schemas,
  revisions, serialized download bytes and decoded UTF-8 source hashes.
  Eight old-GitHub, HTTP and www redirect cases plus the custom 404 passed.
  One HEAD request timed out once and passed its retry; no failures remain in
  that sweep. The same full sweep passed on the ordinary network path with
  111 requests and no retries or failures. Chrome loaded the HTTPS domain and verified the hero
  prompt, selected appearance and home/article navigation without overflow.
  The earlier certificate and local-proxy failures below remain historical
  observations. These checks establish retrieval and rendering on the tested
  paths, not worldwide propagation or agent comprehension. Next action:
  maintain the blog at `https://agentart.work/` and retain its DNS / ownership
  records; no additional domain restart is needed.

- 2026-10-02 custom-domain cutover (Lab-site/release lane): Chrome access to
  the owning Cloudflare account is restored. GitHub verified `agentart.work`
  for `agent-art-collective`; the repository's Pages custom domain is configured.
  Cloudflare now holds the retained verification TXT plus four GitHub Pages A
  records, four AAAA records and a `www` CNAME to
  `agent-art-collective.github.io`, all DNS-only. Commit `d88fb0c` published the
  root-path site build and updated agent prompt; GitHub Actions passed. Public
  DNS and GitHub's DNS check passed. All 44 served files, including 20 pages
  and 15 agent exports, match the checked local build over HTTP directly to
  GitHub's published IP. Local validation passed 45 tests and 442 links; Chrome
  verified root-path home/article navigation, typography and prompt disclosure.
  These checks do not establish HTTPS: GitHub still reports no certificate,
  and strict direct TLS verification rejects the current hostname mismatch.
  The local proxy separately returned resets / HTTP 502 for the new domain.
  A documented certificate-provisioning restart was blocked by automatic
  approval review because it briefly removes the live domain; no removal
  occurred, and operator approval was requested. Next action: wait for issuance
  or carry out one restart if approved, enable HTTPS, then verify secure page
  and export acquisition plus old-URL, HTTP and www redirects. Keep the site
  and repository names unchanged.

- 2026-10-02 custom-domain preparation (Lab-site/release lane): the operator
  registered `agentart.work` and requested connection to the existing Pages
  site. The site and repository names remain Agent Art Lab / Agent-Art-Lab;
  a domain suffix does not require a project rename. Root-path build defaults,
  current links and the hero's canonical agent prompt are prepared locally,
  uncommitted and unpublished. Both root and `/Agent-Art-Lab` override checks
  passed: 20 Node tests, 25 Python tests, 20 pages and 442 links; all 15 agent
  exports passed integrity checks. These are local checks, not live-domain
  evidence. Registration was observed in Cloudflare, and GitHub's organization
  domain-verification challenge is pending. No DNS records or Pages custom
  domain have been changed. Firefox page controls could not be operated reliably;
  the operator was asked to open the owning Cloudflare account in Chrome.
  Next action: add and verify GitHub's TXT challenge, configure DNS and the
  repository custom domain, then publish the root build and verify HTTPS,
  navigation, old-URL redirects and every agent download. Do not publish this
  root-path candidate to the existing project-path URL before that cutover.

- 2026-10-02 selected appearance (Lab-site lane): the operator chose Courier
  New, Regular (400) and Dots from the comparison panel. This is now the default
  in generated HTML, CSS and preference fallbacks, including reading without
  JavaScript. Explicit saved reader choices still take precedence; the panel
  remains available and light/dark colors still follow the system. Agent
  documents are unchanged. Checks passed 44 tests, 20 pages, 442 links and
  eight desktop/mobile browser views in both color themes, plus preference
  storage and no-JavaScript cases. Next action: retain this selected appearance
  as new articles are added.

- 2026-10-02 background textures (Lab-site lane): the floating panel is now
  called Appearance and adds Paper, Linen, Canvas, Laid and Dots, plus Plain
  to restore the original background. Font, weight and texture persist through
  separate local preferences. Native controls, preview swatches, system colors
  and plain-white printing remain available. Local checks passed 44 tests,
  20 pages and 442 links; 48 browser views covered all backgrounds, both color
  themes, desktop and mobile. Keyboard, storage denial, cross-tab changes,
  independent choices and no-JavaScript defaults passed. Visual review found
  the first Paper preview too regular and led to an irregular grain refinement;
  Canvas line intersections were softened after an initial contrast shortfall.
  Paper's eight affected views passed again; sampled text contrast stayed at
  least 4.64:1 in light mode and 6.33:1 in dark mode across the final textures.
  Agent index and all 15 document exports remain byte-identical. These checks
  cover rendering and behavior in Chrome, not reader preference or comprehension.
  Next action: compare the five textures with font and weight on the live site.

- 2026-10-02 font weights (Lab-site lane): the floating Fonts panel now offers
  Light (300), Regular (400) and Bold (700). Font and weight persist independently
  across pages and tabs; source emphasis stays bold. Sixty local Chrome views
  covered all 15 combinations on home/article pages at desktop/mobile widths,
  plus keyboard, storage denial, cross-tab updates and no-JavaScript reading.
  All checks passed after correcting two browser-harness assumptions (default
  preferences need no stored key, and numeric CSS attribute values need quotes).
  Actual glyph inspection found that all five installed fonts use their regular
  face for Light on this machine; the panel explains that fallback when selected.
  Agent index and all 15 document exports remain byte-identical. The browser
  checks establish behavior on this machine, not reader preference or other
  devices' font availability. Next action: compare weights on the live site.

- 2026-10-02 automatic color themes (Lab-site lane): reading pages now follow
  the system light/dark preference through CSS, including changes without a
  reload. The prompt, font picker and native controls use matching colors;
  print keeps dark text on white. Checks passed 76 page/theme/viewport views,
  automatic switching with a saved font, no-JavaScript dark reading and print
  contrast. Measured text contrast stayed above 5.18:1. Agent exports are
  unchanged. Next action: preserve system-following colors in future UI edits.

- 2026-10-02 font chooser (Lab-site lane): added a floating Fonts panel to every
  reading page with Georgia, Palatino, Times New Roman, Arial and Courier New.
  Choices apply across page text and persist locally; the collapsible panel
  starts closed on narrower screens. Native radio controls, keyboard selection,
  Escape, blocked-storage feedback and no-JavaScript reading were verified.
  All five actual typefaces rendered in Chrome; 60 font/page/viewport checks
  passed from 320px to desktop, plus a short landscape screen. Local tests and
  source/export checks passed. Device fonts use fallbacks where unavailable;
  the original style demo remains separate. No agent documents changed.
  Next action: let the operator compare the five fonts on the live site.

- 2026-10-02 larger type (Lab-site lane): increased screen text sizes throughout
  the Quiet editorial site, including responsive overrides and table code.
  Article prose is 21px on desktop and 20px on mobile; summaries are 20px and
  metadata is at least 14px. Build/link checks and 76 browser views passed.
  Next action: retain the larger reading scale in future site edits.

- 2026-10-02 header simplification (Lab-site lane): removed the redundant top
  “Blog” link at the operator's request. The left Agent-Art-Lab name remains the
  home link on every reading page; GitHub remains on the right. Next action:
  preserve this navigation as articles are added.

- 2026-10-02 Quiet editorial (Lab-site lane): the operator selected this style
  for the production blog. The shared site now uses warm paper, a narrow reading
  column, serif type and light rules. The hero's “Read with your agent.” prompt
  is a native disclosure, closed by default; it expands with pointer or keyboard
  and without JavaScript. Its full canonical text stays in the HTML and the copy
  button preserves manual-selection recovery. The agent index and all 15 full
  document exports are byte-identical to the previous build. Local validation
  passed 43 tests, both base paths, 20 generated pages and 442 internal links.
  Chrome checked 19 production pages at four widths (76 views, 320–1440px),
  keyboard toggling/tab order, exact clipboard text, denied-copy recovery and
  no-JavaScript expansion/redirects. A temporary disk-space failure was retried;
  the manual-selection check was corrected to compare the selected source range,
  since rendered text normalizes whitespace. No remaining check failed.
  Method lesson: native disclosure adds the requested interaction without a new
  script; visual and keyboard checks cover behavior absent from byte checks.
  Reader preference and agent comprehension remain unmeasured. Next action:
  maintain the selected style and add future articles through canonical records.

- 2026-10-02 minimal style previews (Lab-site lane): `/style-demo/` now compares
  Plain-text journal, Swiss index and Quiet editorial at the operator's request.
  It replaces the earlier rejected theme proposals. Every preview uses the same
  slogan, complete agent prompt and three recent articles with dates/evidence.
  All 43 tests and 442 internal links passed; 12 theme/viewport checks covered
  320–1440px, with matching content, native clipboard copy, denial recovery and
  no-JavaScript reading. Production pages and agent documents remain byte-identical.
  Next action: let the operator select a style before applying it to the blog.

- 2026-10-02 slogan (Lab-site lane): the operator selected “Articles, studies
  and working notes on Agent Art.” as the slogan. The homepage heading, footer,
  default page description and README now use that exact wording. The existing
  style is retained. Build/link checks, 18 Node tests and both desktop/mobile
  views passed. Next action: keep this wording consistent in future site edits.

- 2026-10-02 single blog (Lab-site lane): the operator requested removing the
  overlapping Journal, Archive and Lessons views. The homepage is now the only
  article feed, labelled Blog. The two old listing URLs redirect to its articles
  section without JavaScript and include readable fallback links. Article return
  links point to that feed; Guidance and reference links are in the footer.
  Canonical records, evidence limits, agent exports and the existing style remain
  intact. Checks passed 43 tests and 448 internal links; ten browser views covered
  home, both old URLs, an article and Guidance at desktop/mobile widths. Native
  copying, denied-copy recovery and both redirects without JavaScript passed.
  Method lesson: separate views of the same small collection added unnecessary
  navigation. Reader preference and Agent comprehension were not measured.
  Next action: maintain one dated blog feed as new articles are added.

- 2026-10-02 journal refinement (Lab-site lane): the operator found the three
  theme proposals generic and chose the existing visual style with a blog-like
  structure. This supersedes the pending theme-selection action below. The
  homepage now lists every article newest first; `/studies/` is a monthly archive,
  and article pages show record dates with previous/next navigation. The large
  featured lesson and project slogans are replaced by the dated feed. The full
  agent prompt stays near the top; source records, old URLs and agent exports
  are preserved. Dates describe the source records, not inferred publication or
  update times. Local checks passed 42 tests, 20 pages and 504 internal links;
  Chrome checked all 20 pages at desktop, tablet and phone widths (60 views),
  including real prompt copying, denial recovery and no-JavaScript reading.
  Method evaluation: reusing the catalogue kept dates/content aligned and avoids
  a second homepage curation step. Reader preference and Agent comprehension
  were not measured. Next action: add future articles through canonical source
  records and catalogue metadata; keep the current visual style for now.

- 2026-10-02 visual theme review (Lab-site lane): the operator requested three
  directions on a demo page. `/style-demo/` compares Field Notes (warm editorial),
  Signal Room (dark research console) and Open Studio (bold public art identity).
  Each uses the same complete guide prompt, P-07 introduction and current study
  records, with working navigation and copy buttons. Styles are isolated; the
  main reading-site theme awaits the operator's selection. Local validation
  passed all 37 tests, 20 pages and 480 internal links. Chrome checks passed all
  three previews at four widths (320–1440px), exact native clipboard/guide parity,
  denied-clipboard recovery and reading without JavaScript. Contrast/source
  review found no blockers. Using identical material helped compare the styles;
  these checks do not measure visitor preference or Agent comprehension.
  Next action: obtain the operator's choice before applying a production theme.

- 2026-10-02 complete site validation (Lab-site lane): fixed lesson previews in
  `949f0b1`; the old multiline regex stopped at source line endings. Markdown
  paragraph extraction now retains all seven complete introductions. Added
  persistent regressions for excerpts, page inventory including 404, exact hero
  prompt parity and visible agent discovery. All 37 tests passed; both site base
  paths passed 19 pages, 40 build files and 432 internal links. Browser checks
  covered all 19 pages at desktop, tablet and mobile widths (57 views).
  After deployment, all 39 public resources passed GET/HEAD and exact-build
  comparisons; the 15 full article texts and seven previews matched their
  sources. A missing nested URL returned the custom 404 and working recovery
  links. Native clipboard copy on the live homepage, simulated denial/manual
  selection and reading without JavaScript passed in a normal Chrome window.
  Initial headless clipboard reads were empty/inconclusive; the normal-window
  check read back the exact prompt. One live HEAD request had a TLS EOF and
  succeeded on one retry; no remaining failure was hidden. Method lesson: link
  and byte checks alone missed truncated previews, so complete-text regressions
  now accompany them. External references, private evidence and general Agent
  comprehension remain outside this check. Next action: retain these CI checks
  and repeat browser/live validation when changing reading routes or interactions.

- 2026-10-02 homepage prompt (Lab-site lane): at the operator's request, the
  homepage hero now displays the canonical access-guide prompt and a copy button,
  with directions to paste it into an agent and add a question. The build reads
  the prompt from the guide so the two stay aligned. Reading/manual copying
  remains available without JavaScript; clipboard denial selects the full text
  and announces manual recovery. Local checks passed 19 pages, 40 public files,
  432 links and all 23 existing tests. Browser checks covered desktop/mobile
  layout, disabled JavaScript and simulated clipboard success/denial. No Agent
  comprehension trial was run. Next action: maintain the guide's canonical
  prompt when changing the document-access contract.

- 2026-10-02 agent-access publication verified (Lab-site lane): commit `8ee23f8`
  passed Pages build/deploy. Direct read-only GET and HEAD checks passed for
  the index, all 15 complete documents, the guide, discovery text, home and CSS;
  JSON responses were `application/json` and fetched bytes matched the local
  build. Source/download identities, lengths and hashes passed, followed by a
  separate saved-file replay with no network code. Index revision:
  `sha256:57465fead5f9277b4fbb020e778ca023772f6c9c5e2d709dd95c68d41aed5ece`.
  This is one client acquisition path, not a comparative Agent trial. Raw
  responses were retained temporarily, not archived in this repo. Offline checks
  passed 19 pages, 39 public files, 431 links, 7 Node tests and 16 Python tests;
  desktop/mobile views had no page-width overflow. Method evaluation: the Pulse
  contract helped separate complete-source and download checks; synthetic
  corruption was rejected, with no unexpected failure in this pass. Discovery
  across Agent products, comprehension and efficiency remain unmeasured.
  This completes the verification action below. Next action: keep export
  selection, canonical documents and evidence labels aligned when adding records.

- 2026-10-02 agent-access implementation (Lab-site lane): the operator requested
  applying the existing document-access lessons to the reading pages. The Pulse
  study, P-07 and native/explicit Guidance support a generated same-origin index
  and complete JSON documents with exact-source hashes, download hashes,
  revisions and evidence labels. [Agent access](docs/AGENT_ACCESS.md) records
  prerequisites, link resolution, verification and failures; existing study
  claims and scopes are preserved. No private records or project code are added.
  Next action: verify the deployed GET/HEAD and saved-byte path. These checks
  concern acquisition and integrity, not comprehension or general reliability.

- 2026-10-02 reading site published: [Agent-Art-Lab website](https://agent-art-collective.github.io/Agent-Art-Lab/)
  is live from site commit `5e8dbbc`; the first Pages build and deployment passed.
  All 18 HTML pages and both assets returned successfully and matched the local
  build byte for byte. Offline validation passed 323 generated links/fragments,
  25 source documents, 78 repository links and all 10 checker tests. Desktop and
  mobile browser inspection found no page-width overflow in the checked views;
  the publication file scan reported no secrets. These validate the reading site,
  not the underlying historical study claims. This completes the first-deployment
  check below. Next action: edit canonical Markdown for article updates and keep
  study metadata, evidence labels and site checks aligned as the archive grows.

- 2026-10-02 reading-site work (Lab establishment): the operator accepted a
  small GitHub Pages reading site for this lessons repository. Home, Lessons,
  Studies and Guidance render the existing Markdown with scoped evidence labels;
  no source study or numbered practice is replaced. A small static build and
  pinned Pages workflow provide publication from `main`. Maintenance is in
  [the site notes](site/README.md). Next action: verify the first deployed site
  and retain the same checks when adding future studies. This scope does not
  authorize project runtime work, private evidence publication or license changes.

- 2026-10-01 publication authorization (Lab project-learning lane): the operator
  subsequently directed rollout of the sanitized native/explicit execution item.
  This supersedes the preparation-only publication boundary in the entry below.
  The four-file contribution comprises Guidance, this handoff, the THOUGHT
  collection index and the new study. Its connecting guidance stays provisional;
  new runtime observations remain OPS-reported, and P-04–P-07 are unchanged.
  Authorization covers ordinary repository publication after review, with no
  private raw records, artwork, runtime work or release changes. Next action:
  revisit the scoped guidance when relevant new evidence becomes available.

- 2026-10-01 local contribution (Lab project-learning lane):
  [native tools and explicit execution prerequisites](projects/thought/studies/2026-10-01-native-explicit-execution.md)
  and a proposed Guidance connection are prepared from the sanitized OPS draft.
  New runtime evidence is OPS-reported; no private underlying records were
  retrieved or live checks run by the Lab. The proposal connects P-04–P-07;
  existing studies and practices are preserved. Applications/OPS retain product
  and release ownership. Next action: operator review of wording and a separate
  publication decision. This handoff authorizes no commit, push, PR or publication.

- 2026-09-28 review completion (project-study lane):
  [PR #1](https://github.com/agent-art-collective/Agent-Art-Lab/pull/1) merged
  as `e875614`. This supersedes the pending review action below. Review of the
  pinned public implementation found no blockers; offline checks passed for
  19 documents, 69 local links and 10 tests, with clean whitespace and secret
  scans. This review did not rerun Pulse's live acquisition or establish its
  private historical reports. P-07 remains provisional within its stated scope.
  Next action: use the Pulse collection as a bounded reference for the next
  operator-selected project study; no new trial or product work is initiated.

- 2026-09-28 contribution: [Pulse document-access study](projects/pulse/studies/2026-09-28-document-access.md)
  and O-07/P-07 are prepared for public PR review at the operator's request.
  This lane is a project study; Lab continuation ownership and Pulse product
  ownership are unchanged. It records a simpler acquisition contract with
  explicit evidence limits, not a measured cross-agent reliability gain.
  Next action: Lab maintainers review the contribution and scoped practice.
  No live agent trial, product deployment or shared tooling is requested.

- Latest work, 2026-09-24: [sanitized THOUGHT follow-up](projects/thought/studies/2026-09-24-boundaries-and-canary-follow-up.md)
  and practical Guidance/findings updated locally from OPS reports. Production
  completion is OPS-reported; no Lab experiment or deployment was performed.
  Initially prepared locally under the OPS handoff; the operator subsequently
  authorized committing and pushing this sanitized update on 2026-09-24.

- Standalone v0 published publicly on 2026-09-21 at
  [agent-art-collective/Agent-Art-Lab](https://github.com/agent-art-collective/Agent-Art-Lab),
  default branch `main`.
- Source originals in Applications remain unchanged; this is an adapted edition.
- Verified organization: `agent-art-collective`; `agent-art` was the earlier
  intended namespace. On 2026-09-21, GitHub API inspection confirmed active
  owner membership for `inshell-art`. The selected repository name remains
  `Agent-Art-Lab`; public visibility is selected. No reuse license was selected.
  Lab publication and the Signature prototype transfer are complete. The
  `signatures.gallery` transfer is on hold at the operator's request.
- THOUGHT provides technical investigations, not a validated general art method.
- Its Codex diagnostic is complete; the product defect remains Applications-owned.
- Its proposed comparison remains draft, unrun and unfrozen.
- Its [practice-led study proposal](projects/thought/studies/2026-09-20-intentional-participation-proposal.md)
  is prepared; artwork inspection remains unrun because material is unavailable.
- No artwork or private raw report is exported here for independent interpretation.
- The initial edition enabled no live agent runner, account configuration, paid
  service or CI. The 2026-10-02 reading site adds documentation checks and a
  GitHub Pages publishing workflow; no Agent trial is part of that workflow.

The objective is a usable Lab home. A THOUGHT repair, new runner, live trial or
deployment is not a prerequisite.

## Ownership transfer completed, 2026-09-20

OPS relayed the operator's explicit direction to pass Agent-Art-Lab to this
dedicated task and return DEPLOY-SUPERVISOR to Inshell deployment. This task
acknowledges and accepts ownership of Lab continuation. The earlier preparation
and naming notes below are historical; task creation is no longer pending.

Agent-Art-Lab owns shared Guidance, research, archive and study preparation.
DEPLOY-SUPERVISOR focuses on Inshell Studio Preview release coordination;
Applications owns product fixes. The intended organization remains `agent-art`.
Bring Lab-specific material, scope and publication decisions to this task.
No repository transfer, remote creation or publication accompanied this task
ownership transfer.

The previously assigned bounded work is complete: the handoff was checked and
the [practice-led proposal](projects/thought/studies/2026-09-20-intentional-participation-proposal.md)
was prepared with an evidence inventory and explicit material gaps. No artwork
was inspected or created, and no live trial ran. The method review is included
in the proposal; it makes no claim of measured efficiency or artistic findings.

Validation: offline packaging checks passed (16 documents, 56 local links),
and all 10 synthetic checker tests passed. These checks do not validate artwork
interpretation or private historical evidence.

## Next bounded Lab action

The bounded 2026-09-24 learning-list handoff is complete locally. It retains
representation, final-worker and safe-diagnostic lessons with functional success
separate from compliance and privacy claims. Raw private evidence was not
imported; no new release gate or shared tooling was added. The operator's later
2026-09-24 instruction authorizes publication of these documentation changes.
No product or release action is needed to complete the Lab update.

Local validation passed: 17 documents, 64 local links, all 10 synthetic checker
tests, whitespace check and a redacted gitleaks scan. These are documentation
checks, not fresh verification of OPS's runtime or production observations.

The requested Signature prototype transfer is complete. Leave the working
`signatures.gallery` repository and its deployment untouched until the operator
explicitly resumes that transfer; no timed retry or automatic continuation is
scheduled. See the [current repository status](docs/ORGANIZATION_AND_SPLIT.md).

The next available Lab study step is to obtain an operator-selected existing
THOUGHT candidate and permitted review material, or defer the proposed inquiry.
No material retrieval, live creation or Inshell release work is implied.

## Prototype transferred; gallery held, 2026-09-21

The operator paused the `signatures.gallery` transfer because work is ongoing
there, and requested transfer of the separate `agent-art-Signature-prototype`
repository instead. GitHub ownership was transferred from `inshell-art` to
`agent-art-collective`, retaining the repository name, public visibility and
default branch `main`:
[agent-art-Signature-prototype](https://github.com/agent-art-collective/agent-art-Signature-prototype).

Before/after API inspection confirmed the same repository identity and remote
`main` commit `d00c018d1a740a5807480126d1f1bd0c620fb96d`. The pre-transfer check
reported no GitHub Pages site, Actions workflows, deployment records or webhooks;
this does not inventory unknown external services or test the artwork.

The existing local prototype checkout's `origin` now uses the new organization.
Tracking refs were fetched, while local `main` and working files were preserved.
The local checkout remains at `0e1a036`, behind the remote; no pull, merge or
prototype code push was performed. The gallery repository and remote were not
modified by this operation.

Later on 2026-09-21, the operator also requested local relocation. The prototype
checkout was moved into the same parent directory as Agent-Art-Lab, retaining
the directory name `agent-art-Signature-prototype`. All files and Git metadata
were verified unchanged across the move; the old checkout location is gone.

## Public Lab publication completed, 2026-09-21

The operator selected public visibility and `agent-art-collective` ownership.
The 19-file edition was reviewed for credentials, personal identifiers, private
artwork and third-party material; the retained research consists of attributed
summaries and links, and raw private evidence remains excluded. Packaging checks
and all 10 synthetic tests passed; gitleaks reported no leaks. These checks do
not verify historical claims or establish a universal method.

Initial commit `177ccab` was pushed to `main`. GitHub subsequently reported
`agent-art-collective/Agent-Art-Lab`, `PUBLIC`, nonempty, with default branch
`main`. The local `origin` points to that repository. No license was added;
publication does not authorize new live trials or publication of private originals.
The dated preparation notes below preserve the state before publication.

## Organization registered and verified, 2026-09-21

The operator reported completed registration. Read-only GitHub API calls found
the actual organization at
[agent-art-collective](https://github.com/agent-art-collective), with `inshell-art`
in active `admin` membership (organization owner). Requests for the previously
intended `agent-art` namespace returned 404; that is not proof of availability.
The registered slug supersedes the planned namespace for future repository
destinations. Earlier dated planning notes remain as history.

The local Lab has no configured remote. The gallery remains
`inshell-art/Agent-Art-signatures.gallery`, public. No new permissions, transfers,
repository publication or license selection were performed during verification.

The prepared practice-led proposal remains available for later continuation:
The operator identifies one existing THOUGHT candidate and the prompt, artifact
and contextual material authorized for review/retention, or defers the inquiry.
The Lab then checks that material's availability and revises the proposal before
interpretation. No private-history retrieval or live creation is implied.

## Handoff review and naming update, 2026-09-20

The operator requested a handoff check and selected **Agent-Art-Lab** as the
project and repository name, replacing Agent Lab / `agent-lab` for current use.
The local directory already has the selected name. Current documentation and
edition metadata now use it; original source paths, hashes and historical
runner identifiers remain unchanged.

This task has begun the Lab continuation with that bounded review and rename.
The task-creation language below records the earlier preparation stage.
Repository-only review found the purpose, evidence limits and ownership split
explicit. No missing chat is needed for this naming change. Publication still
requires destination/control, visibility and licensing decisions; a practice-led
study still lacks an exported artwork and its documented conditions.

Validation after the rename: the offline checker passed (15 documents,
48 local links), all 10 synthetic checker tests passed, and the nine recorded
source-document paths and hashes were unchanged. Source originals were not
re-accessed or rehashed during this review.

Next action: prepare the proposed practice-led study described below, recording
the material gap explicitly. This review does not initiate that study or verify
private historical evidence.

## Operator-directed split, 2026-09-20

The operator will create another agent/task for this local repository.
This handoff prepares that separation; it does not claim a new task exists.

- The new Agent-Art-Lab task continues Lab establishment, repository publication
  preparation and shared research/archive work.
- DEPLOY-SUPERVISOR returns to `inshell.art` Studio Preview release coordination.
- Applications owns the website implementation and its concrete fixes.
- THOUGHT and other practice repositories retain their own implementation and
  ownership. Participation does not require transfer into the shared organization.

Do not use Lab incompleteness to block an unrelated website release, or silently
make a THOUGHT repair the Lab's next task. The source documents in Applications
remain preserved; this standalone repo is the home for the new Lab task's work.

Suggested opening message for the new task:

```text
Continue Agent-Art-Lab establishment in this repository. Read AGENTS.md, README.md,
HANDOFF.md and docs/ORGANIZATION_AND_SPLIT.md. Preserve the intended agent-art
organization context and the split from Inshell deployment. Review current
status and propose the next bounded Lab action; do not assume publication or
live-execution authority. THOUGHT is a worked case, not the Lab's definition.
```

## Validation checkpoint, 2026-09-20

The preparing agent ran the offline checker (14 documents, 42 local links),
all 10 synthetic checker tests, and a local gitleaks scan; all passed.
The nine recorded source documents were rehashed and remained unchanged.
A fresh read-only agent, given only this repository, passed cold-start review:
it identified the purpose, evidence limits, owners, authority and next task.
Its two wording clarifications were applied. This is a usability observation,
not a controlled efficiency study, historical-evidence verification or final
publication approval. Rerun checks after changes.

## Original bounded Lab task (preparation now complete)

First sanity-check this handoff using repository documents alone. Report any question
that depends on missing chat, inaccessible artifacts or an unstated decision.
Correct navigation and explanations only where retained evidence supports it.

Then prepare a proposed practice-led study:

- Ask what observable choices could support intentional Agent participation.
- Inventory already-authorized retained artwork and its documented conditions.
- State whether that material is actually available; none is exported here yet.
- Separate direct observations, interpretations and unknowns.
- Identify the evidence needed and the next bounded action.

Do not invent an artwork, second project or operator mandate. If material is
unavailable, finish the proposed record with that gap explicit. Do not start
new artwork creation, access private stores or execute live trials by implication.

## v0 completion criteria

| Criterion | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Cold-start orientation | New agent explains aim, boundaries, evidence access and next task without chat. |
| Portable package | Offline links/JSON/checker tests pass outside the Applications checkout. |
| Honest archive | Derivative status, private missing evidence and limits explicit. |
| Usable method | Project and study templates cover artistic and technical work without requiring a runner. |
| GitHub publication | Operator confirms destination/visibility; reviewed file set committed and pushed separately. |

The first four concern the local edition. GitHub publication was completed on
2026-09-21 under explicit operator direction. No open-source license is granted.
